### Test Scenarios for the `toss` Function

#### Scenario 1: Correct Input with Winning Result
Details:
  TestName: test_toss_with_correct_input_winning
  Description: This test verifies that if the user inputs a valid choice that matches the random toss result, the function returns 1 indicating that player 1 wins.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the `input` to return '1' (heads) and `random.randint` to return 1.
  Act: Call the toss function.
  Assert: Check that the return value is 1.
Validation:
  Ensuring that when the user's choice matches the toss result, the function correctly identifies the winner. This tests the function's ability to evaluate win conditions accurately.

#### Scenario 2: Correct Input with Losing Result
Details:
  TestName: test_toss_with_correct_input_losing
  Description: This test verifies that if the user inputs a valid choice that does not match the random toss result, the function returns 2 indicating that player 2 wins.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the `input` to return '1' (heads) and `random.randint` to return 2.
  Act: Call the toss function.
  Assert: Check that the return value is 2.
Validation:
  Validates the function's ability to handle cases where the user's choice does not match the toss result, ensuring the correct identification of the game outcome.

#### Scenario 3: Invalid Input Handling
Details:
  TestName: test_toss_with_invalid_input
  Description: This test checks the function's behavior when an invalid input (not 1 or 2) is provided by the user.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the `input` to return '3' (invalid choice).
  Act: Call the toss function, handling any exceptions or errors.
  Assert: The function should handle the situation gracefully, potentially prompting the user again or handling the error.
Validation:
  Important for verifying that the function can robustly handle user input errors without crashing or behaving unexpectedly.

#### Scenario 4: Performance Under Rapid Succession
Details:
  TestName: test_toss_performance_under_rapid_succession
  Description: This test aims to evaluate the performance of the toss function when called repeatedly in rapid succession.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a loop to call the toss function multiple times in quick succession.
  Act: Execute the loop.
  Assert: Monitor execution time and resource usage to ensure they remain within acceptable limits.
Validation:
  Ensures that the function can handle a high load and performs efficiently, important in environments where quick decisions are needed repeatedly.
