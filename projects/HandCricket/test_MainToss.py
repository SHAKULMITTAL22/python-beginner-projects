### Scenario 1: User Chooses Heads and Wins
Details:
  TestName: test_user_chooses_heads_and_wins
  Description: This test verifies that when the user selects "heads" (1) and the random toss also results in "heads" (1), the function correctly identifies the user as the winner.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the `input()` function to return '1' and the `random.randint()` to return 1.
  Act: Call the `toss()` function.
  Assert: Check that the return value of the function is 1, indicating that the user has won.
Validation:
  This test is crucial to ensure that the game logic correctly interprets user input and random outcomes, adhering to the rules that a matching choice between the user and the toss result leads to a user win.

### Scenario 2: User Chooses Tails and Loses
Details:
  TestName: test_user_chooses_tails_and_loses
  Description: This test checks the situation where the user selects "tails" (2), but the random toss results in "heads" (1), leading to the user losing the toss.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the `input()` function to return '2' and the `random.randint()` to return 1.
  Act: Call the `toss()` function.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns 2, indicating that the opponent (player 2) wins.
Validation:
  This scenario ensures the game's fairness and correctness by validating that differing outcomes between the user's choice and the random toss result in a loss for the user.

### Scenario 3: User Input Is Invalid
Details:
  TestName: test_user_input_is_invalid
  Description: This test ensures that the function handles situations where the user input is not a valid choice (neither '1' nor '2').
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the `input()` function to return a non-numeric or unrelated numeric value ('3', 'hello', etc.).
  Act: Call the `toss()` function within a try-except block to handle potential errors.
  Assert: Check that the function raises a ValueError or handles the error gracefully without crashing.
Validation:
  Testing invalid inputs is essential for maintaining robustness and user-friendliness in interactive applications, ensuring that the function prompts correctly or handles errors without interruption of service.

### Scenario 4: Randomness of Toss Outcome
Details:
  TestName: test_randomness_of_toss_outcome
  Description: This test examines whether the toss results are distributed evenly over a significant number of iterations to ensure the randomness of outcomes.
Execution:
  Arrange: Execute the `toss()` function a large number of times (e.g., 1000 times) while mocking `input()` to a fixed value ('1' or '2').
  Act: Record the outcomes of these tosses.
  Assert: Analyze the distribution of results to confirm that both outcomes ('1' and '2') appear approximately equally often, within a reasonable margin of statistical error.
Validation:
  Ensuring the randomness of the `toss()` function's results is vital for game fairness. This test confirms that the random number generator operates as expected, providing unbiased and unpredictable outcomes.
