### Test Scenarios for the `toss` function

#### Scenario 1: Correct Input - Heads Chosen
Details:
  TestName: test_toss_heads_win
  Description: Validate that when the user chooses heads (1) and the random toss also results in heads (1), the function acknowledges the user's win.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the `input` to return "1" and `random.randint` to return 1.
  Act: Call the `toss` function.
  Assert: Check that the function returns 1, indicating the user has won.
Validation:
  This test validates that the function correctly interprets the user's input and the random result, ensuring that the game logic is correctly implemented when the user wins by choosing heads.

#### Scenario 2: Correct Input - Tails Chosen
Details:
  TestName: test_toss_tails_win
  Description: Test to ensure that when the user selects tails (2) and the random toss results in tails (2), the function correctly identifies the user as the winner.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the `input` to return "2" and `random.randint` to return 2.
  Act: Call the `toss` function.
  Assert: Confirm that the function returns 1, showing the user has won.
Validation:
  This scenario checks the game's logic when the user correctly guesses tails, verifying that the function properly handles correct guesses and rewards the user accordingly.

#### Scenario 3: Incorrect Guess
Details:
  TestName: test_toss_incorrect_guess
  Description: Ensure that if the user's guess does not match the toss result, the function returns 2, indicating the other player wins.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock `input` to return "1" and `random.randint` to return 2.
  Act: Call the `toss` function.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns 2.
Validation:
  This test is important to confirm that the function accurately handles incorrect guesses and assigns the win to the other player, maintaining the integrity of the game's rules.

#### Scenario 4: Randomness Test
Details:
  TestName: test_toss_randomness
  Description: This test checks if the randomness of the coin toss is maintained over multiple invocations.
Execution:
  Arrange: Call the `toss` function multiple times with varying mocks for `input` and without mocking `random.randint`.
  Act: Record the results of several tosses.
  Assert: Analyze the distribution of results to ensure randomness.
Validation:
  Testing the randomness is crucial to ensure that the game is fair and the function is not biased towards any particular outcome.

### Test Case Guidelines for the `toss` function
