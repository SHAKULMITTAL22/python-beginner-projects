### Test Scenarios for the `toss` Function

#### Scenario 1: Correct Input with Winning Result
Details:
  TestName: test_toss_with_correct_input_winning
  Description: This test verifies that if the user's choice matches the toss result, the function returns 1 indicating that the player wins the toss.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the `input` function to return a valid choice and `random.randint` to return the same choice.
  Act: Call the `toss` function.
  Assert: Check if the return value is 1.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure the function correctly identifies a win condition based on user input and random output. It tests the fundamental game rule that matching choices result in a win.

#### Scenario 2: Correct Input with Losing Result
Details:
  TestName: test_toss_with_correct_input_losing
  Description: This test checks that if the user's choice does not match the toss result, the function returns 2 indicating that the player loses the toss.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the `input` function to return a valid choice and `random.randint` to return the opposite choice.
  Act: Call the `toss` function.
  Assert: Check if the return value is 2.
Validation:
  This scenario validates the function's ability to accurately handle losing conditions and ensures that it appropriately assigns the win to the other player.

#### Scenario 3: Input Handling and Result Announcement
Details:
  TestName: test_toss_input_handling_and_announcement
  Description: This test ensures that the function handles user input correctly and prints the appropriate result announcement.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the `input` function to return '1' and `random.randint` to return 1.
  Act: Call the `toss` function.
  Assert: Check the printed output for correctness in announcing "Heads!".
Validation:
  Ensuring the correctness of user interaction and result announcement is crucial for user experience. This test checks the feedback given to the player, which is a critical aspect of the game interface.

#### Scenario 4: Exception Handling for Invalid Input
Details:
  TestName: test_toss_with_invalid_input
  Description: This test verifies that the function handles non-integer and out-of-bound inputs gracefully without crashing.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the `input` function to return an invalid choice like 'abc' or '3'.
  Act: Call the `toss` function and handle any exceptions.
  Assert: Verify that the function does not crash and handles the situation appropriately.
Validation:
  This test is essential for ensuring robustness and stability of the function against invalid user inputs, which are common in interactive applications.

### Test Case Guidelines



Following these guidelines will help ensure comprehensive and effective testing of the `toss` function, covering functional correctness, user interaction, and error handling.
