### Test Scenarios for the `toss` Function

#### Scenario 1: Correct User Input (Heads)
Details:
  TestName: test_toss_with_heads_input
  Description: This test verifies that the function behaves correctly when the user inputs '1' for heads and the random toss also results in heads.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the `input` to return '1' and `random.randint` to return 1.
  Act: Call the `toss()` function.
  Assert: Check that the function returns 1 indicating that the player won the toss.
Validation:
  This test ensures that when the user's choice and the toss result match as heads, the function correctly identifies the win condition, aligning with the business logic that the correct guess should result in a player's win.

#### Scenario 2: Correct User Input (Tails)
Details:
  TestName: test_toss_with_tails_input
  Description: This test verifies that the function behaves correctly when the user inputs '2' for tails and the random toss also results in tails.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the `input` to return '2' and `random.randint` to return 2.
  Act: Call the `toss()` function.
  Assert: Check that the function returns 1 indicating that the player won the toss.
Validation:
  This test checks the correctness of the function when both the user's choice and the toss result are tails, ensuring that the function adheres to its defined behavior of rewarding the correct guess.

#### Scenario 3: Incorrect User Input
Details:
  TestName: test_toss_with_incorrect_input
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly handles situations where the user's input does not match the toss result.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the `input` to return '1' (heads) and `random.randint` to return 2 (tails).
  Act: Call the `toss()` function.
  Assert: Check that the function returns 2 indicating that the opponent wins the toss.
Validation:
  This scenario is crucial for validating that the function appropriately handles incorrect guesses by the user, thereby ensuring fairness in the game's logic.

#### Scenario 4: Handling Non-integer User Input
Details:
  TestName: test_toss_with_non_integer_input
  Description: This test examines the function's behavior when the user inputs a non-integer value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the `input` to return a non-integer value, e.g., 'abc'.
  Act: Call the `toss()` function within a try-except block.
  Assert: Expect an exception to be raised due to invalid input conversion to integer.
Validation:
  This test ensures robustness by checking the function's response to invalid input types, which is critical for maintaining the integrity and usability of the application.

### Test Case Guidelines for the `toss` Function
