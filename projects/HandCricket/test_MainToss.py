### Test Scenarios for the `toss` Function

#### Scenario 1: Correct Input with Winning Condition
Details:
  TestName: test_toss_with_correct_input_wins
  Description: This test verifies that if the user's choice matches the toss result, the function returns 1 indicating that the player wins the toss.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the `input()` function to return a specific choice, say "1" for heads.
  Act: Execute the `toss` function.
  Assert: Check if the return value is 1.
Validation:
  This test ensures that when the input matches the random result, the function behaves as expected, returning the correct winner based on the business logic.

#### Scenario 2: Correct Input with Losing Condition
Details:
  TestName: test_toss_with_correct_input_loses
  Description: This test checks that if the user's choice does not match the toss result, the function returns 2 indicating that player 2 wins the toss.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the `input()` function to return a specific choice, say "1" for heads, while the random result is mocked to be "2" for tails.
  Act: Execute the `toss` function.
  Assert: Check if the return value is 2.
Validation:
  Validates the function's ability to accurately determine the losing condition and return the appropriate result.

#### Scenario 3: Input Handling with Non-integer Values
Details:
  TestName: test_toss_with_non_integer_input
  Description: This test verifies the function's behavior when the input is not an integer.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the `input()` function to return a non-integer value, such as "heads".
  Act: Execute the `toss` function expecting it to handle the invalid input.
  Assert: Check for any exceptions or errors, verifying if the function handles or reports them appropriately.
Validation:
  Important to ensure robustness of the function when faced with unexpected input types, contributing to the overall error handling capabilities of the application.

#### Scenario 4: Repeated Invocations and Consistency
Details:
  TestName: test_toss_consistency_over_repeated_invocations
  Description: This test examines the function's consistency and randomness over multiple invocations.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the `input()` function to return a fixed choice, and invoke the `toss` function multiple times.
  Act: Execute the `toss` function repeatedly.
  Assert: Analyze the distribution of results to ensure randomness.
Validation:
  Ensures the function maintains its randomness and does not exhibit any unintended deterministic behavior, which is crucial for the fairness of the game.
