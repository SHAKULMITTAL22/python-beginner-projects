### Test Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Correct User Choice for Heads
Details:
  TestName: test_correct_user_choice_heads
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly identifies when the user chooses heads and the toss result is heads, resulting in the user winning.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the input to return '1' and the random.randint to return 1.
  Act: Call the toss function.
  Assert: Check that the return value is 1.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly processes and matches user input with the random result for a heads choice, adhering to the game rules that the user wins if their choice matches the toss.

#### Scenario 2: Correct User Choice for Tails
Details:
  TestName: test_correct_user_choice_tails
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly identifies when the user chooses tails and the toss result is tails, resulting in the user winning.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the input to return '2' and the random.randint to return 2.
  Act: Call the toss function.
  Assert: Check that the return value is 1.
Validation:
  This test checks the correctness of user win logic when the user's choice of tails matches the toss result, ensuring the game's integrity.

#### Scenario 3: Incorrect User Choice
Details:
  TestName: test_incorrect_user_choice
  Description: Verifies that the function correctly identifies a mismatch between user choice and toss result, resulting in the opponent's win.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the input to return '1' (heads) and random.randint to return 2 (tails).
  Act: Call the toss function.
  Assert: Check that the return value is 2.
Validation:
  This scenario tests the function's ability to handle cases where the user's choice does not match the toss result, crucial for ensuring fair gameplay where the correct player is declared as winner.

#### Scenario 4: Invalid User Input
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_user_input
  Description: Tests the function's response to invalid input, such as non-numeric or out-of-range numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the input to return '3' (invalid choice).
  Act: Try to call the toss function and handle any exceptions.
  Assert: Expect the function to raise an error or handle the input gracefully.
Validation:
  Validates that the function has robust error handling for invalid user inputs, maintaining game integrity and user experience.

#### Scenario 5: Performance Under Rapid Succession
Details:
  TestName: test_toss_performance_under_rapid_succession
  Description: Ensures that the function performs reliably under rapid, repeated invocations.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a loop to call the toss function multiple times in quick succession.
  Act: Execute the loop.
  Assert: Check that all calls are processed without errors or performance degradation.
Validation:
  This test checks the resilience and performance of the function under stress, important for scenarios where the function might be used frequently within a short period.

### Test Case Guidelines
```

```
These guidelines focus on ensuring comprehensive coverage of both expected and edge cases, with specific attention to the function's dependencies on external input and random outcomes.
