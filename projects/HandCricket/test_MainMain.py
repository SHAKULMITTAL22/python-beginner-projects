### Test Scenarios for the `main` function

#### Scenario 1: Valid Inputs and Player 1 Wins the Toss and Chooses to Bat First
Details:
  TestName: test_valid_inputs_player1_wins_toss_bats_first
  Description: This test verifies that the game processes valid inputs correctly when Player 1 wins the toss and chooses to bat first.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock inputs for number of overs, toss, player choices, and difficulty level.
  Act: Call the `main` function using the mocked inputs.
  Assert: Check that the final output correctly displays Player 1's choice and the game flow follows the batting order accordingly.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the game logic correctly handles the scenario where Player 1 wins the toss and opts to bat, reflecting accurate game dynamics and user choices.

#### Scenario 2: Valid Inputs and Player 2 Wins the Toss and Chooses to Bowl First
Details:
  TestName: test_valid_inputs_player2_wins_toss_bowls_first
  Description: This test checks the game's behavior when Player 2 wins the toss and chooses to bowl first.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock inputs for number of overs, toss result favoring Player 2, player choices, and difficulty level.
  Act: Execute the `main` function with these inputs.
  Assert: Validate that the output properly reflects Player 2's choice to bowl and the game order is maintained.
Validation:
  Validates the correct implementation of game logic when Player 2 wins the toss and the effect of this decision on the game's progression.

#### Scenario 3: Invalid Number of Overs Input
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_overs_input
  Description: This scenario tests the game's response to an invalid input for the number of overs.
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide a non-integer input for the number of overs.
  Act: Run the `main` function with this input.
  Assert: Expect the game to handle the error, outputting an "Invalid input, exiting game" message.
Validation:
  Ensures robust error handling in the game for incorrect data types, preventing crashes and guiding the user to correct errors.

#### Scenario 4: Boundary Condition for Number of Overs
Details:
  TestName: test_boundary_overs_input
  Description: Tests the game's behavior at the boundary values for the number of overs (1 and 10).
Execution:
  Arrange: Test with the minimum (1) and maximum (10) valid overs.
  Act: Execute the `main` function for each case.
  Assert: Confirm that the game operates correctly at these boundaries.
Validation:
  Critical for verifying that the game handles edge cases for user inputs, adhering to specified limits without errors.

#### Scenario 5: Difficulty Level Edge Cases
Details:
  TestName: test_difficulty_level_edge_cases
  Description: Test the game's response to minimum and maximum valid difficulty levels.
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide edge values for difficulty (1 and 3) and other valid inputs.
  Act: Run the `main` function with these parameters.
  Assert: Ensure the game accepts these inputs and progresses without errors.
Validation:
  Validates that the game correctly implements difficulty settings at their boundaries, crucial for gameplay complexity management.

#### Scenario 6: Handling of Extreme Input Values
Details:
  TestName: test_extreme_input_values
  Description: Examine how the game behaves with extreme input values, such as a very high number of overs.
Execution:
  Arrange: Input an extremely high value for overs, within integer limits but beyond typical gameplay (e.g., 1000).
  Act: Invoke the `main` function with this input.
  Assert: Check for performance issues or errors.
Validation:
  Tests the game's performance and stability under stress, ensuring it remains robust under unusual but valid conditions.

### BEGIN_GUIDELINE
**Correctness**: Ensure that the game processes inputs correctly and follows the expected game logic, including the correct sequence of batting and bowling based on the toss and player choices.

**Boundary Conditions**: Focus on the lower and upper limits of the number of overs and difficulty levels, ensuring that the game handles these gracefully.

**Error Handling**: Implement tests that provide invalid inputs (e.g., strings for overs or difficulty) and check that the game exits or handles errors gracefully without crashing.

**Performance**: Assess how the game handles a larger-than-normal number of overs, ensuring that performance does not degrade unexpectedly.

**Security**: While not heavily emphasized in this context, ensure that user inputs are used safely and only in expected manners, particularly guarding against any form of input that might disrupt the flow or operation of the game.
