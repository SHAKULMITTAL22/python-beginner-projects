================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-20
Issue: Invalid or Improper Input Validation - The code accepts user input directly without any validation. This can lead to various issues, including crashes if the input is not a valid number.
Solution: Implement input validation to ensure the entered values are valid numbers. Use try-except blocks to handle exceptions and provide user feedback accordingly.

Vulnerability: CWE-398
Issue: Code Quality - The code contains syntax errors and improper import statements (e.g., 'import os,import time' is invalid). Poor code quality can lead to unexpected behavior and potential security risks.
Solution: Correct the import statements and ensure the code is syntactically correct. Use a linter to catch such mistakes before deployment.

Vulnerability: CWE-758
Issue: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision - The code relies on user input for arithmetic operations without verifying the inputs, which may lead to incorrect calculations or errors.
Solution: Sanitize and validate user inputs before processing them. Ensure that the inputs are within acceptable ranges and types.

Vulnerability: CWE-209
Issue: Information Exposure Through an Error Message - If an invalid input is given, the program might crash and expose stack traces or other sensitive information.
Solution: Use proper exception handling to catch errors and provide user-friendly error messages without exposing internal details.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Subtracting two positive numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_subtract_two_positive_numbers
  Description: Verify that the function correctly subtracts two positive numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare two positive numbers, e.g., 10 and 5.
  Act: Invoke the subtraction function with these two numbers.
  Assert: Check if the result is 5.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly handles basic subtraction of positive numbers, a fundamental aspect of its intended use.

Scenario 2: Subtracting a positive number from a negative number
Details:
  TestName: test_subtract_positive_from_negative
  Description: Verify that the function correctly subtracts a positive number from a negative number.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a negative number and a positive number, e.g., -5 and 10.
  Act: Invoke the subtraction function with these two numbers.
  Assert: Check if the result is -15.
Validation:
  This test checks the function's ability to handle subtraction where the minuend is negative and the subtrahend is positive, ensuring robustness in varied input scenarios.

Scenario 3: Subtracting two negative numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_subtract_two_negative_numbers
  Description: Verify that the function correctly subtracts two negative numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare two negative numbers, e.g., -10 and -5.
  Act: Invoke the subtraction function with these two numbers.
  Assert: Check if the result is -5.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function can handle subtraction when both numbers are negative, which is crucial for comprehensive functionality.

Scenario 4: Subtracting zero from a number
Details:
  TestName: test_subtract_zero_from_number
  Description: Verify that the function correctly subtracts zero from a number.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a number and zero, e.g., 10 and 0.
  Act: Invoke the subtraction function with these two numbers.
  Assert: Check if the result is 10.
Validation:
  This test confirms that subtracting zero does not change the number, aligning with basic arithmetic principles.

Scenario 5: Subtracting a number from zero
Details:
  TestName: test_subtract_number_from_zero
  Description: Verify that the function correctly subtracts a number from zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare zero and a number, e.g., 0 and 10.
  Act: Invoke the subtraction function with these two numbers.
  Assert: Check if the result is -10.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly handles cases where zero is the minuend, which is important for expected arithmetic operations.

Scenario 6: Subtracting two floating-point numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_subtract_two_floats
  Description: Verify that the function correctly subtracts two floating-point numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare two floating-point numbers, e.g., 10.5 and 5.3.
  Act: Invoke the subtraction function with these two numbers.
  Assert: Check if the result is approximately 5.2.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the function can handle floating-point arithmetic and precision, which is critical for accurate calculations.

Scenario 7: Subtracting very large numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_subtract_large_numbers
  Description: Verify that the function correctly subtracts very large numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare two large numbers, e.g., 1e10 and 5e9.
  Act: Invoke the subtraction function with these two numbers.
  Assert: Check if the result is 5e9.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function can handle large numerical values without overflow or precision errors, which is essential for scalability.

Scenario 8: Subtracting very small numbers (close to zero)
Details:
  TestName: test_subtract_small_numbers
  Description: Verify that the function correctly subtracts very small numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare two small numbers, e.g., 1e-10 and 5e-11.
  Act: Invoke the subtraction function with these two numbers.
  Assert: Check if the result is approximately 5e-11.
Validation:
  This test checks the functionâ€™s precision and accuracy when dealing with very small numbers, ensuring robustness in all ranges of input values.

Scenario 9: Subtracting identical numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_subtract_identical_numbers
  Description: Verify that the function correctly subtracts identical numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare two identical numbers, e.g., 10 and 10.
  Act: Invoke the subtraction function with these two numbers.
  Assert: Check if the result is 0.
Validation:
  This test confirms that subtracting a number from itself yields zero, a basic arithmetic principle.

Scenario 10: Subtracting numbers resulting in a negative number
Details:
  TestName: test_subtract_resulting_in_negative
  Description: Verify that the function correctly handles subtraction that results in a negative number.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare two numbers where the subtrahend is greater than the minuend, e.g., 5 and 10.
  Act: Invoke the subtraction function with these two numbers.
  Assert: Check if the result is -5.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function can handle cases where the result of the subtraction is negative, which is important for accurate arithmetic operations.
