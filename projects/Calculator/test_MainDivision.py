Scenario 1: Division of Two Positive Numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_division_of_two_positive_numbers
  Description: Verify that the function correctly divides two positive numbers and returns the expected quotient.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare two positive numbers as inputs.
  Act: Invoke the `division` function with these inputs.
  Assert: Check that the returned quotient matches the expected result.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the basic functionality of dividing two positive numbers works as expected.

Scenario 2: Division by Zero
Details:
  TestName: test_division_by_zero
  Description: Verify that the function handles division by zero correctly by returning "Invalid entry".
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a positive number as the numerator and zero as the denominator.
  Act: Invoke the `division` function with these inputs.
  Assert: Check that the function returns "Invalid entry".
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function gracefully handles division by zero, which is a common edge case.

Scenario 3: Division of a Negative Number by a Positive Number
Details:

  Description: Verify that the function correctly divides a negative number by a positive number.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a negative number as the numerator and a positive number as the denominator.
  Act: Invoke the `division` function with these inputs.
  Assert: Check that the returned quotient matches the expected result.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly handles the division of negative numbers by positive numbers, which is essential for comprehensive arithmetic operations.

  This test ensures that the function can return fractional results, which is important for accuracy in arithmetic operations.

Scenario 7: Division of Zero by a Positive Number
Details:
  TestName: test_division_of_zero_by_positive
  Description: Verify that the function correctly handles division of zero by a positive number.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare zero as the numerator and a positive number as the denominator.
  Act: Invoke the `division` function with these inputs.
  Assert: Check that the returned quotient is zero.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly handles cases where the numerator is zero, which is a common edge case.

Scenario 8: Division of Zero by a Negative Number
Details:
  TestName: test_division_of_zero_by_negative
  Description: Verify that the function correctly handles division of zero by a negative number.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare zero as the numerator and a negative number as the denominator.
  Act: Invoke the `division` function with these inputs.
  Assert: Check that the returned quotient is zero.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly handles cases where the numerator is zero, even when the denominator is negative.

Scenario 9: Division Resulting in a Very Small Number
Details:
  TestName: test_division_resulting_in_very_small_number
  Description: Verify that the function correctly handles division resulting in a very small quotient.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a small numerator and a large denominator.
  Act: Invoke the `division` function with these inputs.
  Assert: Check that the returned quotient is a very small number.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function can handle cases where the result is a very small number, which is important for precision in arithmetic operations.

Scenario 10: Division Resulting in a Very Large Number
Details:
  TestName: test_division_resulting_in_very_large_number
  Description: Verify that the function correctly handles division resulting in a very large quotient.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a large numerator and a small denominator.
  Act: Invoke the `division` function with these inputs.
  Assert: Check that the returned quotient is a very large number.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function can handle cases where the result is a very large number, which is important for precision in arithmetic operations in financial and scientific calculations.
