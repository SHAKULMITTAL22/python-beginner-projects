Scenario 1: Division of Two Positive Numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_division_positive_numbers
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly divides two positive numbers, ensuring that basic division functionality works as expected.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the input function to return two positive numbers, e.g., 10 and 2.
  Act: Invoke the division function.
  Assert: Check that the function returns 5.0 and prints "5.0".
Validation:
  This test is crucial to confirm the function's ability to perform standard division operations, a fundamental aspect of its intended use.

Scenario 2: Division by Zero
Details:
  TestName: test_division_by_zero
  Description: This test checks the function's response when attempting to divide a number by zero, which should be gracefully handled.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the input function to return a non-zero number for the first input and zero for the second input.
  Act: Invoke the division function.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns "Invalid entry" and prints "Invalid entry".
Validation:
  The test ensures that the function adheres to the mathematical rule that division by zero is undefined, aligning with user expectations for error handling.

Scenario 3: Division of Negative and Positive Number
Details:
  TestName: test_division_negative_positive
  Description: This test examines the function's capability to handle division when the dividend is negative and the divisor is positive.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the input function to return a negative number for the first input and a positive number for the second input, e.g., -10 and 2.
  Act: Invoke the division function.
  Assert: Confirm that the function returns -5.0 and prints "-5.0".
Validation:
  This scenario checks the function's robustness in handling negative numbers, ensuring the result reflects the correct mathematical outcome.

Scenario 4: Division of Positive and Negative Number
Details:
  TestName: test_division_positive_negative
  Description: This test evaluates the function's behavior when dividing a positive number by a negative number.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the input function to return a positive number for the first input and a negative number for the second input, e.g., 10 and -2.
  Act: Invoke the division function.
  Assert: Ensure that the function returns -5.0 and prints "-5.0".
Validation:
  This test is important to verify that the function correctly handles division resulting in a negative quotient, maintaining mathematical accuracy.

Scenario 5: Division of Two Negative Numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_division_negative_numbers
  Description: This test checks the function's ability to correctly divide two negative numbers, resulting in a positive quotient.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the input function to return two negative numbers, e.g., -10 and -2.
  Act: Invoke the division function.
  Assert: Check that the function returns 5.0 and prints "5.0".
Validation:
  The test confirms that the function correctly applies the rule that dividing two negative numbers yields a positive result, ensuring logical consistency.

Scenario 6: Division Resulting in a Fraction
Details:
  TestName: test_division_fraction_result
  Description: This test verifies that the function can handle division resulting in a fractional number.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the input function to return numbers that result in a fractional quotient, e.g., 7 and 2.
  Act: Invoke the division function.
  Assert: Confirm that the function returns 3.5 and prints "3.5".
Validation:
  Testing for fractional results ensures that the division function can handle non-integer outcomes, broadening its usability and correctness.
