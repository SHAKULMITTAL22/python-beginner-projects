ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=division_20eff41573


### BEGIN_GUIDELINE
**Correctness**: The function should correctly divide two numbers when valid inputs are provided. It should handle and return precise results for both integer and floating-point divisions.

**Boundary Conditions**: The function should be tested with boundary values such as very large or very small numbers to validate that it handles extreme values correctly and does not result in overflow or underflow errors.

**Error Handling**: The function must gracefully handle division by zero by providing a meaningful error message and not crashing the program. This must be explicitly tested to ensure reliability.

**Performance**: Although not explicitly required by the function's current design, if performance becomes a concern (e.g., in a scaled-up version handling large datasets), tests should be designed to assess the function's efficiency and responsiveness.

**Security**: Input validation should be verified, particularly to ensure that the function is not susceptible to injection attacks or other forms of input manipulation that could compromise the application's integrity.
### END_GUIDELINE

### Test Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Division of two positive numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_division_of_positive_numbers
  Description: Verify that the division function correctly divides two positive numbers and returns the correct result.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare input values 10 and 2.
  Act: Call the division function with these values.
  Assert: Check that the return value is 5.
Validation:
  This test validates that the basic arithmetic operation of division is performed correctly, which is essential for the trustworthiness of mathematical operations in the application.

#### Scenario 2: Division by zero
Details:
  TestName: test_division_by_zero
  Description: Ensure that dividing by zero is handled gracefully by the function and returns an appropriate error message.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare input values 10 and 0.
  Act: Call the division function with these values.
  Assert: Check that the return value is "Invalid entry".
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function adheres to mathematical rules and handles exceptions appropriately, which is crucial for preventing runtime errors and maintaining application stability.

#### Scenario 3: Division of two negative numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_division_of_negative_numbers
  Description: Verify that the division function correctly handles the division of two negative numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare input values -10 and -2.
  Act: Call the division function with these values.
  Assert: Check that the return value is 5.
Validation:
  This test checks the correctness of the division operation when dealing with negative numbers, ensuring that the sign is handled correctly.

#### Scenario 4: Division of a positive number by a negative number
Details:
  TestName: test_positive_divided_by_negative
  Description: Verify that the division function correctly handles the division of a positive number by a negative number.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare input values 10 and -2.
  Act: Call the division function with these values.
  Assert: Check that the return value is -5.
Validation:
  This scenario tests the arithmetic rule that dividing a positive number by a negative number should yield a negative result, which is important for ensuring accurate mathematical calculations.

#### Scenario 5: Division of zero by a number
Details:
  TestName: test_zero_divided_by_number
  Description: Verify that dividing zero by any non-zero number returns zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare input values 0 and 10.
  Act: Call the division function with these values.
  Assert: Check that the return value is 0.
Validation:
  This test confirms the mathematical property that zero divided by any non-zero number should result in zero, an essential aspect of division operations.
