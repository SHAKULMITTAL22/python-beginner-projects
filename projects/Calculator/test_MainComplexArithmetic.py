Scenario 1: Correct Complex Addition
Details:
  TestName: test_complex_addition_correctness
  Description: Verify that the function correctly performs addition on complex numbers when choice '1' is selected.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a mock input for choice '1' and a list of integer pairs representing complex numbers.
  Act: Invoke the function with the prepared input.
  Assert: Check that the function returns the correct sum of the real and imaginary parts formatted as "real+ iimag".
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of ensuring that the addition operation adheres to complex number arithmetic rules.

Scenario 2: Correct Complex Subtraction
Details:
  TestName: test_complex_subtraction_correctness
  Description: Verify that the function correctly performs subtraction on complex numbers when choice '2' is selected.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a mock input for choice '2' and a list of integer pairs representing complex numbers.
  Act: Invoke the function with the prepared input.
  Assert: Check that the function returns the correct difference of the real and imaginary parts formatted as "real+ iimag".
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of ensuring that the subtraction operation adheres to complex number arithmetic rules.

Scenario 3: Correct Complex Multiplication
Details:
  TestName: test_complex_multiplication_correctness
  Description: Verify that the function correctly performs multiplication on complex numbers when choice '3' is selected.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a mock input for choice '3' and a list of exactly four integers representing two complex numbers.
  Act: Invoke the function with the prepared input.
  Assert: Check that the function returns the correct product of the real and imaginary parts formatted as "real+ iimag".
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of ensuring that the multiplication operation adheres to complex number arithmetic rules.

Scenario 4: Correct Complex Division
Details:
  TestName: test_complex_division_correctness
  Description: Verify that the function correctly performs division on complex numbers when choice '4' is selected, avoiding division by zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a mock input for choice '4' and a list of exactly four integers representing two complex numbers, ensuring the divisor is not zero.
  Act: Invoke the function with the prepared input.
  Assert: Check that the function returns the correct quotient of the real and imaginary parts formatted as "real+ iimag".
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of ensuring that the division operation adheres to complex number arithmetic rules and handles edge cases such as division by zero.

Scenario 5: Handling Invalid Choice
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_choice_handling
  Description: Verify that the function handles invalid choices gracefully.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a mock input with a choice that is not '1', '2', '3', or '4'.
  Act: Invoke the function with the prepared input.
  Assert: Ensure that the function does not perform any arithmetic operation or returns a specific message indicating an invalid choice.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of handling user input errors to maintain robustness and user-friendliness.

Scenario 6: Handling Incorrect Number of Inputs
Details:
  TestName: test_incorrect_number_of_inputs_handling
  Description: Verify that the function handles cases where the number of input integers does not match the expected count for the chosen operation.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a mock input for any choice with an incorrect number of integers.
  Act: Invoke the function with the prepared input.
  Assert: Ensure that the function either raises an appropriate exception or returns an error message.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of ensuring input validation to prevent unexpected behavior or crashes.
