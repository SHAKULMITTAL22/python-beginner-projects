Scenario 1: Validate Complex Addition with Multiple Pairs
Details:
  TestName: test_complex_addition_multiple_pairs
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly adds multiple pairs of real and imaginary numbers when the choice is '1'.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the input to simulate the user entering '1' followed by a series of numbers representing complex numbers, such as "2 3 4 5".
  Act: Invoke the function complex_arithmetic and capture the output.
  Assert: Check that the output is "6+ i8", confirming the correct summation of real parts (2+4) and imaginary parts (3+5).
Validation:
  Rationalize that the test ensures the function accurately performs complex addition, a core requirement of the business logic.

Scenario 2: Validate Complex Subtraction with Multiple Pairs
Details:
  TestName: test_complex_subtraction_multiple_pairs
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly subtracts multiple pairs of real and imaginary numbers when the choice is '2'.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the input to simulate the user entering '2' followed by a series of numbers representing complex numbers, such as "10 5 3 2".
  Act: Invoke the function complex_arithmetic and capture the output.
  Assert: Check that the output is "7+ i3", ensuring the correct subtraction of real parts (10-3) and imaginary parts (5-2).
Validation:
  Rationalize that the test ensures the function accurately performs complex subtraction, supporting the function's core operations.

Scenario 3: Validate Complex Multiplication with Two Pairs
Details:
  TestName: test_complex_multiplication_two_pairs
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly multiplies two complex numbers when the choice is '3'.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the input to simulate the user entering '3' followed by exactly four numbers, such as "1 2 3 4".
  Act: Invoke the function complex_arithmetic and capture the output.
  Assert: Check that the output is "-5+ i10", confirming the correct calculation using the formula (a*c - b*d) + i(a*d + b*c).
Validation:
  Rationalize that the test ensures the function accurately performs complex multiplication, validating a critical mathematical operation.

Scenario 4: Validate Complex Division with Two Pairs
Details:
  TestName: test_complex_division_two_pairs
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly divides two complex numbers when the choice is '4'.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the input to simulate the user entering '4' followed by exactly four numbers, such as "1 2 3 4".
  Act: Invoke the function complex_arithmetic and capture the output.
  Assert: Check that the output is approximately "0.44+ i0.08", verifying the correct division calculation using the formula (a*c + b*d) / (c^2 + d^2) + i(b*c - a*d) / (c^2 + d^2).
Validation:
  Rationalize that the test ensures the function accurately performs complex division, which is essential for handling division of complex numbers.

Scenario 5: Validate Handling of Insufficient Input for Multiplication
Details:
  TestName: test_insufficient_input_multiplication
  Description: This test checks if the function handles cases where fewer than four numbers are provided for multiplication.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the input to simulate the user entering '3' followed by fewer than four numbers, such as "1 2".
  Act: Invoke the function complex_arithmetic and capture the behavior.
  Assert: Ensure that the function raises an appropriate error or handles the case gracefully, such as returning a specific error message.
Validation:
  Rationalize that the test is necessary to ensure the function can handle input errors gracefully, maintaining robustness and user experience.

Scenario 6: Validate Division by Zero in Complex Division
Details:
  TestName: test_division_by_zero
  Description: This test verifies that the function handles division by zero when performing complex division.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the input to simulate the user entering '4' followed by numbers that lead to division by zero, such as "1 2 0 0".
  Act: Invoke the function complex_arithmetic and capture the behavior.
  Assert: Ensure that the function raises an appropriate error or handles the division by zero gracefully.
Validation:
  Rationalize that the test is crucial to ensure the function can handle division by zero, a common edge case in mathematical operations.
