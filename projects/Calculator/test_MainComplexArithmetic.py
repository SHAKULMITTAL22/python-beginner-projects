Scenario 5: Handling of Division by Zero
Details:
  TestName: test_complex_division_by_zero_handling
  Description: Test how the function handles division by zero in the complex division scenario.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a simulated input for choice '4' with the second complex number's real and imaginary parts set to zero.
  Act: Invoke the function with this input.
  Assert: Verify the function raises an appropriate error or handles the situation gracefully.
Validation:
  Ensures robustness and error handling in the function, particularly in scenarios where division by zero could occur, maintaining application stability.

Scenario 6: Handling Insufficient Input for Multiplication or Division
Details:
  TestName: test_insufficient_input_handling
  Description: Verify the function's behavior when less than four numbers are provided for multiplication or division.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a simulated input for choices '3' or '4' with fewer than four numbers.
  Act: Invoke the function with this input.
  Assert: Check if the function raises an error or handles the input gracefully.
Validation:
  This test ensures the function can handle edge cases where input data is incomplete, maintaining reliability and user guidance.

Scenario 7: Correct Input Parsing and Error for Non-Integer Input
Details:
  TestName: test_non_integer_input_handling
  Description: Test how the function handles non-integer input values for any operation choice.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare simulated input strings containing non-integer values for any of the operations.
  Act: Invoke the function with this input.
  Assert: Verify that the function raises a ValueError or provides a meaningful error message.
Validation:
  Confirms the function's robustness against invalid input data, ensuring it fails gracefully without causing unexpected behavior.
