================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The code does not validate the input for the choice of operation. This can lead to unexpected behavior if a user inputs a non-numeric or out-of-range value.
Solution: Validate the input to ensure it is one of the expected choices ('1', '2', '3', '4').

Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The code does not validate the length of the input list for arithmetic operations, which can result in index errors or incorrect calculations.
Solution: Validate the length of the input list before performing arithmetic operations to ensure it has the expected number of elements.

Vulnerability: CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data
Issue: The use of `input` to read user input directly can lead to code injection if the input is evaluated or executed.
Solution: Use safer methods to handle user input, such as explicit parsing and validation of the input data.

Vulnerability: CWE-703: Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions
Issue: The code does not handle potential exceptions, such as division by zero or invalid integer conversion, which can cause the program to crash.
Solution: Implement exception handling using try-except blocks to gracefully manage potential errors.

Vulnerability: CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials
Issue: The code does not contain hard-coded credentials, but it is a reminder to avoid such practices, especially when handling sensitive operations.
Solution: Ensure that any sensitive information, such as credentials, is stored securely and not hard-coded into the application.
