Scenario 1: Verify average calculation for a standard set of positive integers
Details:
  TestName: test_average_standard_positive_integers
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly calculates the average of a standard set of positive integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the input to provide a standard set of positive integers (e.g., "1 2 3 4 5").
  Act: Call the function `average()`.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is 3.0.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly processes typical, valid input and performs the average calculation accurately, which is crucial for its core functionality.

Scenario 2: Verify average calculation for a set of negative integers
Details:
  TestName: test_average_negative_integers
  Description: This test ensures that the function correctly handles and calculates the average of a set of negative integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the input to provide a set of negative integers (e.g., "-1 -2 -3 -4 -5").
  Act: Call the function `average()`.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is -3.0.
Validation:
  This test confirms the function's ability to handle negative numbers, ensuring robustness in various scenarios.

Scenario 3: Verify average calculation for a mix of positive and negative integers
Details:
  TestName: test_average_mixed_integers
  Description: This test verifies the function's ability to calculate the average of a mixed set of positive and negative integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the input to provide a mix of positive and negative integers (e.g., "1 -1 2 -2 3 -3").
  Act: Call the function `average()`.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is 0.0.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function can handle and correctly compute the average in cases where positive and negative numbers are mixed.

Scenario 4: Verify average calculation for a single integer
Details:
  TestName: test_average_single_integer
  Description: This test checks the function's behavior when the input consists of a single integer.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the input to provide a single integer (e.g., "5").
  Act: Call the function `average()`.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is 5.0.
Validation:
  This test is important to confirm that the function can handle minimal input and still produce a correct result.

Scenario 5: Verify average calculation for repeated integers
Details:
  TestName: test_average_repeated_integers
  Description: This test verifies the function's behavior when the input consists of repeated integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the input to provide repeated integers (e.g., "4 4 4 4 4").
  Act: Call the function `average()`.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is 4.0.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly handles cases where all input numbers are the same, which is a common edge case.

Scenario 6: Verify average calculation for input with zeros
Details:
  TestName: test_average_with_zeros
  Description: This test checks the function's behavior when the input includes zeros.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the input to provide a mix of numbers including zeros (e.g., "0 0 0 5 5").
  Act: Call the function `average()`.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is 2.0.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function can handle zeros appropriately within the input and still produce a correct average.

Scenario 7: Verify average calculation for an empty input
Details:
  TestName: test_average_empty_input
  Description: This test checks the function's behavior when the input is empty.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the input to provide an empty string.
  Act: Call the function `average()`.
  Assert: Check that the function raises a ValueError or similar exception.
Validation:
  This test is important for verifying that the function can handle invalid input gracefully, maintaining robustness and preventing undefined behavior.

Scenario 8: Verify average calculation for large numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_average_large_numbers
  Description: This test ensures the function can correctly calculate the average of a set of large numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the input to provide a set of large numbers (e.g., "1000000 2000000 3000000").
  Act: Call the function `average()`.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is 2000000.0.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the function can handle and accurately compute averages for large numbers, ensuring it performs well with a wide range of input values.

Scenario 9: Verify average calculation for floating-point numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_average_floating_point_equivalents
  Description: This test checks the function's behavior when the input consists of integers that represent floating-point equivalents.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the input to provide integers that would represent a floating-point average (e.g., "1 2 3 4").
  Act: Call the function `average()`.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is 2.5.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function can handle and correctly compute the average in cases where the result is not an integer, verifying its precision and correctness.

Scenario 10: Verify average calculation for a large number of elements
Details:
  TestName: test_average_large_number_of_elements
  Description: This test verifies the function's performance and correctness when calculating the average of a large number of elements.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the input to provide a large number of integers (e.g., "1 2 3 ... 1000").
  Act: Call the function `average()`.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is the correct average of the provided series.
Validation:
  This test ensures the function can handle large data sets efficiently and still produce accurate results, which is important for scalability and performance.
