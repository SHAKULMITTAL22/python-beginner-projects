================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Uncontrolled format string (CWE-134)
Issue: The input() function is used directly without any form of validation. This can lead to format string attacks if the user input contains any format specifiers.
Solution: Replace input() function with a safer alternative that doesn't evaluate the user input. Use raw_input() in Python 2.x or input() in Python 3.x. Additionally, use string formatting methods instead of string concatenation to prevent format string attacks.

Vulnerability: Improper Input Validation (CWE-20)
Issue: The input from the user is converted to integer without checking if the input is a valid number. This can lead to ValueError if the user enters anything other than a number.
Solution: Add a validation check to ensure the user input is a valid number. This can be done using a try-except block to catch any ValueError.

Vulnerability: Insecure Dependency (CWE-829)
Issue: The os and time modules are imported but not used anywhere in the code. This can lead to potential security risks if an attacker can somehow inject malicious code that uses these modules.
Solution: Remove any unused imports from the code. Keep the code as lean as possible to reduce potential attack surface.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test for valid input
Details:
  TestName: test_average_valid_input
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the average function correctly calculates the average of a list of numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a string of space-separated integers.
  Act: Call the average function with the prepared string.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is the expected average of the given numbers.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the average function works correctly with valid inputs. The expected result is the correct average of the numbers, as per the function's specifications.

Scenario 2: Test for empty input
Details:
  TestName: test_average_empty_input
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the average function returns an appropriate error message when no input is given.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare an empty string.
  Act: Call the average function with the empty string.
  Assert: Check if a ZeroDivisionError is raised.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the average function handles empty inputs correctly. The expected result is a ZeroDivisionError, as per the function's specifications.

Scenario 3: Test for single number input
Details:
  TestName: test_average_single_number
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the average function returns the same number when only one number is given as input.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a string with a single integer.
  Act: Call the average function with the single integer string.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is the same as the input number.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the average function works correctly when only one number is given as input. The expected result is the same as the input number, as per the function's specifications.

Scenario 4: Test for negative numbers input
Details:
  TestName: test_average_negative_numbers
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the average function correctly calculates the average when the input numbers are negative.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a string of space-separated negative integers.
  Act: Call the average function with the prepared string.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is the expected average of the given negative numbers.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the average function works correctly with negative numbers. The expected result is the correct average of the negative numbers, as per the function's specifications.
