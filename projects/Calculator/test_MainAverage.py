Scenario 1: Validate correct average calculation with positive integers
Details:
  TestName: test_average_with_positive_integers
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly calculates the average of a list of positive integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Simulate input by providing a string of space-separated positive integers, e.g., "10 20 30 40".
  Act: Call the `average` function and capture the result.
  Assert: Check that the result equals 25.0, which is the correct average of the input numbers.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly implements the fundamental business logic of averaging a list of positive integers, a common use case.

Scenario 2: Handle division by zero when no numbers are input
Details:
  TestName: test_average_with_empty_input
  Description: This test checks if the function gracefully handles the scenario where no numbers are provided, which would result in a division by zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Simulate input with an empty string.
  Act: Call the `average` function.
  Assert: Verify that a ZeroDivisionError is raised.
Validation:
  This test is crucial to ensure the function can handle edge cases like empty input, preventing runtime errors that could disrupt user experience.

Scenario 3: Calculate average when input numbers include negatives
Details:
  TestName: test_average_with_negative_numbers
  Description: This test checks whether the function correctly calculates the average when the input includes negative numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Simulate input with a mix of positive and negative numbers, e.g., "10 -20 30 -40".
  Act: Call the `average` function and capture the result.
  Assert: Confirm that the result is -5.0, the correct average of the input numbers.
Validation:
  Ensuring correct behavior with both positive and negative numbers is vital for the robustness of the function.

Scenario 4: Validate average calculation with a single number
Details:
  TestName: test_average_with_single_number
  Description: This test verifies that the function returns the same number as the average when only one number is input.
Execution:
  Arrange: Simulate input with a single number, e.g., "42".
  Act: Call the `average` function and capture the result.
  Assert: Check that the result equals 42, the input number itself.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the function handles the simplest case correctly, returning the input number as the average.

Scenario 5: Verify average calculation with mixed integers and zero
Details:
  TestName: test_average_with_zero_in_input
  Description: This test checks if the function correctly calculates the average when zero is included among other integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Simulate input with numbers including zero, e.g., "0 10 20 30".
  Act: Call the `average` function and capture the result.
  Assert: Verify that the result is 15.0, the correct average of the input numbers.
Validation:
  Testing with zero is important to ensure the function's accuracy and correctness in handling a full range of integer inputs.

Scenario 6: Confirm response to non-numeric input
Details:
  TestName: test_average_with_non_numeric_input
  Description: This test checks the function's behavior when non-numeric input is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Simulate input with non-numeric values, e.g., "a b c".
  Act: Call the `average` function.
  Assert: Verify that a ValueError is raised due to invalid input conversion.
Validation:
  This test is essential to ensure the function's robustness against invalid input, maintaining data integrity and user safety.

Scenario 7: Validate correct average for large numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_average_with_large_numbers
  Description: This test checks whether the function correctly calculates the average of very large numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Simulate input with large numbers, e.g., "1000000000 2000000000 3000000000".
  Act: Call the `average` function and capture the result.
  Assert: Confirm that the result is 2000000000.0, the correct average of the input numbers.
Validation:
  This test ensures the function can handle large values without overflow or precision errors, critical for applications involving large datasets.
