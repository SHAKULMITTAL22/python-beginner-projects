ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=average_59ae449da4


Scenario 1: Validate correct average calculation with positive integers
Details:
  TestName: test_average_with_positive_integers
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly calculates the average of a list of positive integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Simulate input by providing a string of space-separated positive integers, e.g., "10 20 30 40".
  Act: Call the `average` function and capture the result.
  Assert: Check that the result equals 25.0, which is the correct average of the input numbers.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly processes typical input and performs the intended arithmetic operation, which is critical for its primary business logic.

Scenario 2: Handle a single-element input
Details:
  TestName: test_average_with_single_element
  Description: This test checks if the function can handle a list with a single integer, returning the integer itself as the average.
Execution:
  Arrange: Simulate input by providing a single integer, e.g., "42".
  Act: Call the `average` function and capture the result.
  Assert: Verify that the result is 42.0, as the average of a single number should be the number itself.
Validation:
  Ensures robustness in scenarios with minimal input, conforming to expected behavior for edge cases.

Scenario 3: Handle mixed positive and negative integers
Details:
  TestName: test_average_with_mixed_integers
  Description: This test examines how the function calculates the average when both positive and negative integers are present.
Execution:
  Arrange: Simulate input by providing a string of mixed integers, e.g., "10 -20 30 -40".
  Act: Call the `average` function and capture the result.
  Assert: Confirm that the result is -5.0, which is the correct average of the input numbers.
Validation:
  Validates the function's ability to handle diverse numerical input and correctly compute the average, which is essential for its intended use.

Scenario 4: Handle zero in the input list
Details:
  TestName: test_average_with_zero
  Description: This test checks if the function correctly calculates the average when the input list includes zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Simulate input by providing a string of numbers that includes zero, e.g., "0 10 20".
  Act: Call the `average` function and capture the result.
  Assert: Ensure the result is 10.0, as the average of 0, 10, and 20 is 10.0.
Validation:
  Confirms the function's correctness in processing numbers with zero, ensuring accurate arithmetic operations.

Scenario 5: Handle an input that results in a floating-point average
Details:
  TestName: test_average_results_in_float
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly handles situations where the average is a non-integer (floating-point number).
Execution:
  Arrange: Simulate input by providing a string of integers, e.g., "1 2 3".
  Act: Call the `average` function and capture the result.
  Assert: Verify that the result is 2.0, reflecting the correct average of the input numbers.
Validation:
  Ensures the function appropriately handles and returns floating-point results, which is crucial for maintaining precision in calculations.

Scenario 6: Handle empty input gracefully
Details:
  TestName: test_average_with_empty_input
  Description: This test checks how the function handles an empty input scenario, expecting it to address division by zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Simulate input by providing an empty string or no input.
  Act: Call the `average` function and observe the behavior.
  Assert: Verify that the function raises an appropriate exception, such as a `ZeroDivisionError`.
Validation:
  Assesses the function's robustness and error handling capabilities, which are vital for preventing unexpected crashes in real-world usage.
