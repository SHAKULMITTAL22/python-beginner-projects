================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Uncontrolled format string (CWE-134)
Issue: The input() function is used directly without any form of validation. This can lead to format string attacks if the user input contains format specifiers.
Solution: Use raw_input() instead of input() in Python 2.x. In Python 3.x, input() is safe. However, always validate and sanitize user input.

Vulnerability: Denial of Service (DoS)
Issue: The code lacks error handling for the case when the user does not input any numbers. This will lead to a ZeroDivisionError and crash the program.
Solution: Add error handling to check if the list of numbers is empty before calculating the average.

Vulnerability: Untrusted Search Path (CWE-426)
Issue: The os and time modules are imported but not used in the code. This might lead to vulnerabilities if an attacker can manipulate the search path that Python uses to locate these modules.
Solution: Remove unnecessary import statements. Always keep the Python environment secure and isolated, especially when running scripts with elevated privileges.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test for valid input
Details:
  TestName: test_average_valid_input
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the average function correctly calculates the average of a list of numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a string of space-separated integers.
  Act: Call the average function with the prepared string.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is the expected average of the given numbers.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the average function works correctly with valid inputs. The expected result is the correct average of the numbers, as per the function's specifications.

Scenario 2: Test for empty input
Details:
  TestName: test_average_empty_input
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the average function returns an appropriate error message when no input is given.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare an empty string.
  Act: Call the average function with the empty string.
  Assert: Check that the function raises a ZeroDivisionError.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the average function handles edge cases like empty input correctly. The expected result is a ZeroDivisionError, as the function's specifications indicate that it calculates the average by dividing the sum by the length of the numbers.

Scenario 3: Test for input with non-integer values
Details:
  TestName: test_average_non_integer_input
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the average function returns an appropriate error message when the input contains non-integer values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a string of space-separated values, at least one of which is not an integer.
  Act: Call the average function with the prepared string.
  Assert: Check that the function raises a ValueError.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the average function handles error conditions like non-integer inputs correctly. The expected result is a ValueError, as the function's specifications indicate that it only accepts integer inputs.

Scenario 4: Test for negative integers
Details:
  TestName: test_average_negative_integers
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the average function correctly calculates the average of a list of negative integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a string of space-separated negative integers.
  Act: Call the average function with the prepared string.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is the expected average of the given numbers.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the average function correctly handles negative numbers. The expected result is the correct average of the negative numbers, as per the function's specifications.

Scenario 5: Test for a single integer
Details:
  TestName: test_average_single_integer
  Description: This test is intended to verify if the average function correctly calculates the average of a single integer.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a string with a single integer.
  Act: Call the average function with the prepared string.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is the same as the given number.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the average function correctly handles scenarios where only a single number is given. The expected result is the same number, as the average of a single number is the number itself, as per the function's specifications.
