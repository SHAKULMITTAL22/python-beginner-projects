### Test Scenarios for the `average` Function

#### Scenario 1: Correct Calculation of Average
Details:
  TestName: test_average_with_positive_numbers
  Description: Validate that the function correctly calculates the average of a given list of positive integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a string of space-separated positive integers to simulate user input.
  Act: Redirect standard input to this string and call the `average` function.
  Assert: Check if the returned value matches the expected average.
Validation:
  Ensuring the function calculates the correct average for a typical case is crucial for the reliability of any operations dependent on this function.

#### Scenario 2: Average with Negative Numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_average_with_negative_numbers
  Description: Ensure the function can correctly compute the average when the input consists entirely of negative numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide a string of space-separated negative integers as input.
  Act: Redirect input and execute the `average` function.
  Assert: Verify that the output is the correct average of the provided numbers.
Validation:
  This test verifies the function's capability to handle negative inputs, which is essential for comprehensive data analysis applications.

#### Scenario 3: Average with Zero
Details:
  TestName: test_average_with_zero
  Description: Check the behavior of the function when the input includes zero, alongside other numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Input a mix of zero and other numbers as a string.
  Act: Simulate input and invoke the function.
  Assert: Confirm that the function returns the correct mathematical average.
Validation:
  Testing with zero is important to confirm that the function handles it correctly as it can be a common value in real-world data sets.

#### Scenario 4: Empty Input
Details:
  TestName: test_average_with_no_input
  Description: Test the function's response to an empty input, which should ideally lead to an error or a defined behavior.
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide an empty string as input.
  Act: Redirect input and call the function.
  Assert: Expect an exception or a specific return value indicating invalid input.
Validation:
  It's vital to ensure the function robustly handles empty inputs to prevent runtime errors in a production environment.

#### Scenario 5: Large Number of Inputs
Details:
  TestName: test_average_with_large_input_set
  Description: Assess the function's performance and correctness when handling a large number of inputs.
Execution:
  Arrange: Generate a large list of integers converted to a space-separated string.
  Act: Redirect this large input to the function.
  Assert: Ensure the function returns the correct average without performance degradation.
Validation:
  This scenario checks both the correctness and efficiency of the function under stress, which is critical for scalability.

#### Scenario 6: Non-integer Input Handling
Details:
  TestName: test_average_with_non_integer_input
  Description: Verify how the function deals with inputs that are not integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Provide a string containing non-integer values (e.g., letters or special characters).
  Act: Redirect this input and run the function.
  Assert: Expect an error indicating invalid input types.
Validation:
  This test ensures the function has proper error handling for non-integer inputs, enhancing its reliability and user experience.

### Testing Guidelines

**BEGIN_GUIDELINE**

**Correctness**: 
- Test with various input types including mixed, positive, negative, and zero integers.
- Confirm the average is calculated as expected mathematically.

**Boundary Conditions**:
- Consider testing with the smallest and largest numbers expected.
- Include scenarios with only one number or the maximum possible numbers.

**Error Handling**:
- Ensure the function gracefully handles scenarios like empty input and non-integer values.
- Check for appropriate exceptions or error messages that guide the user.

**Performance**:
- Measure function response times with increasingly large input sizes.
- Evaluate if there is a performance bottleneck and ensure it scales well.

**Security**:
- Since the function takes input, ensure inputs are sanitized to prevent injection attacks or errors.
- Consider the implications of exceptionally large inputs or unexpected input types.

**END_GUIDELINE**

These tests and guidelines ensure the `average` function operates reliably and efficiently in various scenarios, maintaining both user trust and data integrity.

# Notes on changes:
# 1. The import statement was corrected to assume a valid Python package/module structure.
# 2. Used 'with pytest.raises' directly for exception handling in tests to make it more readable and Pythonic.
# 3. Provided comprehensive assert messages to clarify what each test is validating.
# 4. The test methods are marked with pytest markers for categorization and filtered execution.
# 5. Ensured all test cases handle and assert the intended functionality clearly and correctly.
