ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=average_59ae449da4

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-89
Issue: The code uses `input()` function to take user input without any validation or sanitization. This can lead to injection attacks if the input is used in a sensitive context.
Solution: Implement input validation and sanitization to ensure that the input conforms to expected formats and does not contain malicious payloads.

Vulnerability: CWE-703
Issue: The code does not handle potential exceptions that may arise from invalid user input, such as non-integer values or division by zero.
Solution: Implement exception handling using `try` and `except` blocks to catch and manage errors like `ValueError` and `ZeroDivisionError`.

Vulnerability: CWE-780
Issue: The code imports `os` and `time` modules but does not use them. Unused imports can lead to maintenance issues and might introduce vulnerabilities if the code is expanded later.
Solution: Remove unnecessary imports to reduce the attack surface and improve code readability and maintainability.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Verify Average Calculation with Positive Integers
Details:
  TestName: test_average_with_positive_integers
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly calculates the average of a list of positive integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a mock input of a space-separated string of positive integers.
  Act: Invoke the `average` function with the prepared input.
  Assert: Check that the returned average is correct.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of correctly computing the average as it is a fundamental part of statistical analysis and mathematical operations.

Scenario 2: Verify Average Calculation with Negative Integers
Details:
  TestName: test_average_with_negative_integers
  Description: This test checks if the function correctly handles and calculates the average of a list of negative integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a mock input of a space-separated string of negative integers.
  Act: Invoke the `average` function with the prepared input.
  Assert: Verify that the returned average is correct.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of handling negative numbers, as they are common in financial and scientific computations.

Scenario 3: Verify Average Calculation with Mixed Positive and Negative Integers
Details:
  TestName: test_average_with_mixed_integers
  Description: This test ensures the function can handle a mix of positive and negative integers and compute the correct average.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a mock input of a space-separated string of mixed positive and negative integers.
  Act: Invoke the `average` function with the prepared input.
  Assert: Confirm that the returned average is correct.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of handling mixed integers to ensure robustness in various real-world scenarios where data can have both positive and negative values.

Scenario 4: Verify Average Calculation with Zero
Details:
  TestName: test_average_with_zero
  Description: This test checks if the function correctly includes zero in the average calculation.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a mock input of a space-separated string of integers including zero.
  Act: Invoke the `average` function with the prepared input.
  Assert: Validate that the returned average is correct.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of correctly incorporating zero in calculations as it is a neutral element in arithmetic operations.

Scenario 5: Verify Average Calculation with a Single Number
Details:
  TestName: test_average_with_single_number
  Description: This test verifies that the function returns the number itself when only one number is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a mock input of a single number.
  Act: Invoke the `average` function with the prepared input.
  Assert: Check that the returned average is the number itself.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of correctly handling edge cases where the input list contains only one element.

Scenario 6: Verify Average Calculation with Identical Numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_average_with_identical_numbers
  Description: This test ensures that the function correctly calculates the average when all numbers in the list are identical.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a mock input of a space-separated string of identical numbers.
  Act: Invoke the `average` function with the prepared input.
  Assert: Confirm that the returned average is equal to the identical number.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of handling uniform data sets where all elements are the same, often seen in controlled experiments or specific data sets.

Scenario 7: Verify Average Calculation with Large Numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_average_with_large_numbers
  Description: This test checks if the function correctly calculates the average of a list containing large integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a mock input of a space-separated string of large integers.
  Act: Invoke the `average` function with the prepared input.
  Assert: Verify that the returned average is correct.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of handling large numbers to ensure the function's capability to process high-value financial or scientific data.

Scenario 8: Verify Error Handling with No Input
Details:
  TestName: test_average_with_no_input
  Description: This test checks if the function appropriately handles the case where no input is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a mock input of an empty string.
  Act: Invoke the `average` function with the prepared input.
  Assert: Confirm that an appropriate error (e.g., ZeroDivisionError) is raised.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of validating edge cases to ensure the function's robustness and capability to handle erroneous inputs gracefully.

Scenario 9: Verify Error Handling with Non-numeric Input
Details:
  TestName: test_average_with_non_numeric_input
  Description: This test checks if the function appropriately handles non-numeric input.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a mock input of a space-separated string containing non-numeric characters.
  Act: Invoke the `average` function with the prepared input.
  Assert: Confirm that an appropriate error (e.g., ValueError) is raised.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of input validation to ensure the function's robustness and prevent runtime errors in production environments.
