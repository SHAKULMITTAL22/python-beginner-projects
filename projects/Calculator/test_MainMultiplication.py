================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Uncontrolled Input (CWE-20)
Issue: The code takes input directly from the user and attempts to convert it to integers. This could lead to a ValueError if the user enters anything other than a number.
Solution: Surround the input conversion with try/except to catch and handle possible ValueErrors.

Vulnerability: Unused Imports (CWE-116)
Issue: The 'os' and 'time' modules are imported but not used, which is a bad practice and could potentially introduce security risks if later misused.
Solution: Remove unused imports to reduce the attack surface of the application.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Valid Multiplication of Positive Numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_valid_multiplication_positive_numbers
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the multiplication function correctly multiplies a series of positive numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare the input string of positive numbers separated by spaces.
  Act: Pass the input string to the function.
  Assert: Check that the output is the expected product of all the numbers.
Validation:
  Rationale: The multiplication function is expected to correctly multiply all the numbers in the series. This test verifies that it meets this requirement when dealing with positive numbers.

Scenario 2: Valid Multiplication of Negative Numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_valid_multiplication_negative_numbers
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the multiplication function correctly multiplies a series of negative numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare the input string of negative numbers separated by spaces.
  Act: Pass the input string to the function.
  Assert: Check that the output is the expected product of all the numbers.
Validation:
  Rationale: The multiplication function is expected to correctly multiply all the numbers in the series. This test verifies that it meets this requirement when dealing with negative numbers.

Scenario 3: Multiplication including Zero
Details:
  TestName: test_multiplication_including_zero
  Description: This test verifies that the multiplication function correctly handles a series of numbers that includes zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare the input string of numbers, including zero, separated by spaces.
  Act: Pass the input string to the function.
  Assert: Check that the output is zero, as any multiplication that includes zero should result in zero.
Validation:
  Rationale: This test verifies that the multiplication function correctly handles zero, which is a special case in multiplication operations.

Scenario 4: Multiplication of a Single Number
Details:
  TestName: test_multiplication_single_number
  Description: This test verifies that the multiplication function correctly handles a single number.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare the input string with a single number.
  Act: Pass the input string to the function.
  Assert: Check that the output is equal to the input number, as the multiplication of a single number should result in the number itself.
Validation:
  Rationale: This test verifies that the multiplication function correctly handles a single number, which could be a common case in practical usage.

Scenario 5: Multiplication of No Numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_multiplication_no_numbers
  Description: This test verifies that the multiplication function correctly handles an empty input.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare an empty input string.
  Act: Pass the empty string to the function.
  Assert: Check that the output is one, as the multiplication of no numbers should result in one.
Validation:
  Rationale: This test verifies that the multiplication function correctly handles an empty input, which is a corner case in multiplication operations.
