================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-676: Use of Potentially Dangerous Function
Issue: The os library in Python can be used to perform potentially dangerous operations such as command injection, file manipulation, etc. If user inputs were involved and not properly sanitized, it could lead to severe issues.
Solution: Avoid using the os library unless absolutely necessary. If you must use it, ensure all user inputs are properly sanitized and validated before use.

Vulnerability: CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption ('Resource Exhaustion')
Issue: The factorial function doesn't check if the input number is too large. Calculating factorial of a very large number could lead to high CPU and memory usage, potentially causing a Denial of Service (DoS).
Solution: Add a check to limit the input number for the factorial function. If the number is too large, throw an exception or return an error.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test for a positive integer input to the factorial function
Details:
  TestName: test_factorial_positive_integer
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the factorial function correctly calculates the factorial of a positive integer.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Invoke the factorial function with a positive integer as a parameter.
  Assert: Check that the function returns the correct factorial of the input integer.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test: This test is crucial as it verifies the main functionality of the factorial function, i.e., correctly calculating the factorial of a positive integer.

Scenario 2: Test for zero input to the factorial function
Details:
  TestName: test_factorial_zero
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the factorial function correctly handles the edge case where the input is zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Invoke the factorial function with zero as a parameter.
  Assert: Check that the function returns 1, as the factorial of zero is defined as 1.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test: This test is important as it verifies that the factorial function correctly handles the edge case of zero input, adhering to the mathematical definition of factorial.

Scenario 3: Test for negative integer input to the factorial function
Details:
  TestName: test_factorial_negative_integer
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the factorial function behaves as expected when provided with a negative integer as an input.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Invoke the factorial function with a negative integer as a parameter.
  Assert: Check that the function returns 1, as the factorial of a negative number is undefined and the function's current implementation returns 1 for such inputs.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test: This test is crucial as it checks how the function handles invalid inputs, such as negative integers. The function should not crash or behave unpredictably. 

Scenario 4: Test for a large integer input to the factorial function
Details:
  TestName: test_factorial_large_integer
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the factorial function can handle large integers without causing any overflow errors.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Invoke the factorial function with a large integer as a parameter.
  Assert: Check that the function returns the correct factorial of the input large integer.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test: This test is important to ensure that the function can handle large inputs without causing any overflow errors, which might happen if the function's implementation is not robust enough.
