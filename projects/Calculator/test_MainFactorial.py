Here are the test scenarios for the given `factorial` function, crafted to validate its business logic and behavior under various conditions.

### Scenario 1: Validate Factorial of Zero
Details:
  TestName: test_factorial_of_zero
  Description: Verify that the factorial function returns 1 when the input is 0, as 0! is defined as 1.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup is required.
  Act: Invoke `factorial` with the parameter `num=0`.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is `1`.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test as it confirms the mathematical definition of 0!, ensuring the function handles this edge case correctly.

### Scenario 2: Validate Factorial of One
Details:
  TestName: test_factorial_of_one
  Description: Verify that the factorial function returns 1 when the input is 1, as 1! is defined as 1.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup is required.
  Act: Invoke `factorial` with the parameter `num=1`.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is `1`.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test to confirm the function's correctness for the smallest positive integer, ensuring basic functionality.

### Scenario 3: Validate Factorial of a Small Positive Integer
Details:
  TestName: test_factorial_of_small_positive_integer
  Description: Verify that the factorial function returns the correct result for a small positive integer, such as 5.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup is required.
  Act: Invoke `factorial` with the parameter `num=5`.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is `120` (since 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120).
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test as it ensures the function handles typical use cases for small integers correctly.

### Scenario 4: Validate Factorial of a Larger Positive Integer
Details:
  TestName: test_factorial_of_larger_positive_integer
  Description: Verify that the factorial function returns the correct result for a larger positive integer, such as 10.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup is required.
  Act: Invoke `factorial` with the parameter `num=10`.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is `3628800` (since 10! = 10 × 9 × ... × 2 × 1 = 3628800).
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test as it ensures the function correctly computes factorials for larger numbers, testing the loop's operation over more iterations.

### Scenario 5: Validate Factorial of a Negative Integer
Details:
  TestName: test_factorial_of_negative_integer
  Description: Verify the function's behavior when a negative integer is passed, as factorial is not defined for negative numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup is required.
  Act: Invoke `factorial` with a negative parameter, such as `num=-1`.
  Assert: Check that the function raises an appropriate exception or handles it gracefully.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test to confirm robust error handling and input validation, ensuring the function's reliability and correctness in handling invalid inputs.

### Scenario 6: Validate Factorial of a Large Number for Performance
Details:
  TestName: test_factorial_of_large_number_performance
  Description: Evaluate the performance of the factorial function when computing factorial for a large number, ensuring it completes within a reasonable time.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup is required.
  Act: Invoke `factorial` with a large number, such as `num=100`.
  Assert: Ensure the function completes execution in a reasonable time frame without errors.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test to ensure the function's performance and scalability, verifying it can handle large computations efficiently.
