Here are the test scenarios for the given `factorial` function using the pytest framework:

### Scenario 1: Calculating Factorial of Zero
Details:
  TestName: test_factorial_of_zero
  Description: Verify that the function correctly returns 1 when the input is 0, as 0! is defined to be 1.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup is required.
  Act: Invoke `factorial` with the parameter `num` set to 0.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is 1.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test by ensuring that the function adheres to the mathematical definition of factorial, which states that 0! = 1.

### Scenario 2: Calculating Factorial of a Positive Integer
Details:
  TestName: test_factorial_of_positive_integer
  Description: Validate that the function correctly computes the factorial of a positive integer (e.g., 5! = 120).
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup is required.
  Act: Invoke `factorial` with the parameter `num` set to 5.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is 120.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance by confirming that the function can handle typical use cases of calculating factorials for positive integers accurately.

### Scenario 3: Large Number Factorial Calculation
Details:
  TestName: test_factorial_of_large_number
  Description: Ensure the function can handle large numbers and return the correct factorial value without performance degradation or errors.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup is required.
  Act: Invoke `factorial` with a large number, such as `num` set to 20.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is 2,432,902,008,176,640,000.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance by ensuring the function handles larger inputs, which is crucial for applications needing large number computations.

### Scenario 4: Factorial of One
Details:
  TestName: test_factorial_of_one
  Description: Validate that the function correctly handles the edge case where the input is 1, returning 1 as 1! = 1.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup is required.
  Act: Invoke `factorial` with the parameter `num` set to 1.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is 1.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance by covering edge cases to ensure robustness and correctness of the implementation.

### Scenario 5: Negative Number Input
Details:
  TestName: test_factorial_of_negative_number
  Description: Verify that the function handles negative input appropriately, as factorial is not defined for negative numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup is required.
  Act: Invoke `factorial` with a negative number, such as `num` set to -5.
  Assert: Check that the function raises a ValueError or handles the case gracefully.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance by ensuring that the function gracefully handles invalid inputs, preventing undefined behavior or incorrect outputs.

### Scenario 6: Non-Integer Input
Details:
  TestName: test_factorial_of_non_integer
  Description: Ensure the function handles non-integer input appropriately, as factorial is defined only for non-negative integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup is required.
  Act: Invoke `factorial` with a non-integer, such as `num` set to 5.5.
  Assert: Check that the function raises a TypeError or handles the case gracefully.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance by confirming that the function adheres to the mathematical constraints of factorial, which is defined for integers only.
