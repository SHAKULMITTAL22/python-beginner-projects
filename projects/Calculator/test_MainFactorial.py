================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Unnecessary imports
Issue: The code imports 'os' and 'time' modules, but doesn't use them. Unnecessary imports can lead to security vulnerabilities if the imported modules have vulnerabilities themselves, or if they are used in an insecure way in the future.
Solution: Remove the 'os' and 'time' imports unless they are needed. Always minimize the use of imports to what's necessary.

Vulnerability: Lack of input validation
Issue: The 'factorial' function doesn't validate its input. If a negative number or a non-integer is passed, it will cause an unexpected behavior or error.
Solution: Add input validation to the 'factorial' function. It should check that the input is a positive integer, and raise an exception or return an error if it's not.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test for a positive integer input to the factorial function
Details:
  TestName: test_factorial_positive_integer
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function correctly computes the factorial of a positive integer.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup is required for this test.
  Act: The function will be invoked with a positive integer as a parameter.
  Assert: The expected outcome is the correct factorial of the input number. This will be checked by comparing the function's output to the expected result.
Validation:
  Rationalize: It's important to ensure that the function correctly handles its main use case, which is calculating the factorial of a positive integer. The expected result is derived from the mathematical definition of a factorial.

Scenario 2: Test for zero as input to the factorial function
Details:
  TestName: test_factorial_zero
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function correctly handles an input of zero, which has a defined factorial of 1.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup is required for this test.
  Act: The function will be invoked with zero as the parameter.
  Assert: The expected outcome is 1, as the factorial of zero is defined as 1. This will be checked by comparing the function's output to the expected result.
Validation:
  Rationalize: The factorial of zero is a well-defined mathematical concept, so it's important to ensure that the function correctly handles this input. The expected result is derived from the mathematical definition of a factorial.

Scenario 3: Test for a negative integer input to the factorial function
Details:
  TestName: test_factorial_negative_integer
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function correctly handles a negative integer input, which does not have a defined factorial.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup is required for this test.
  Act: The function will be invoked with a negative integer as the parameter.
  Assert: The expected outcome is not defined, as the factorial of a negative number is undefined. This will be checked by asserting that the function raises an exception or returns a specific error value.
Validation:
  Rationalize: It's important to ensure that the function correctly handles invalid inputs, such as negative integers. The expected result is derived from the mathematical definition of a factorial, which is undefined for negative numbers.
