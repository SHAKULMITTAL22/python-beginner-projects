================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-20
Issue: Improper Input Validation: The code does not validate or sanitize the input from the user, which can lead to unexpected behavior or errors.
Solution: Implement input validation to ensure that only valid numbers are processed. For example, use a try-except block to handle non-integer inputs.

Vulnerability: CWE-703
Issue: Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions: The code does not handle the case where the input list is empty, which will result in a ZeroDivisionError.
Solution: Add a check to ensure that the input list is not empty before performing the division. If the list is empty, prompt the user again or handle the exception gracefully.

Vulnerability: CWE-758
Issue: Reliance on Undefined, Unspecified, or Implementation-Defined Behavior: The use of import statement with a comma is incorrect and will raise a syntax error.
Solution: Correct the import statement to use proper syntax: `import os` and `import time` on separate lines.

Vulnerability: CWE-89
Issue: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection'): Although not directly applicable here, the practice of taking raw input without validation can lead to SQL injection if the input is used in SQL queries elsewhere in the code.
Solution: Always sanitize and validate user inputs, especially when they are used in contexts like SQL queries. Use parameterized queries or ORM frameworks to mitigate SQL injection risks.

================================================================================
Sure, let's outline several test scenarios for the `average` function. These scenarios will cover a range of cases, including typical inputs, edge cases, and error conditions, to ensure the function behaves as expected.

### Scenario 1: Average of Positive Integers
Details:
  TestName: test_average_of_positive_integers
  Description: Verify that the function correctly calculates the average of a list of positive integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Simulate user input of "1 2 3 4 5".
  Act: Call the `average` function.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is 3.0.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of ensuring that the function correctly handles basic positive integers, a common use case.

### Scenario 2: Average of Negative Integers
Details:
  TestName: test_average_of_negative_integers
  Description: Verify that the function correctly calculates the average of a list of negative integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Simulate user input of "-1 -2 -3 -4 -5".
  Act: Call the `average` function.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is -3.0.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of ensuring that the function correctly handles negative integers, as this is a valid input scenario.

### Scenario 3: Average of Mixed Positive and Negative Integers
Details:
  TestName: test_average_of_mixed_integers
  Description: Verify that the function correctly calculates the average of a list containing both positive and negative integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Simulate user input of "-1 2 -3 4 -5".
  Act: Call the `average` function.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is -0.6.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of ensuring that the function correctly handles a mix of positive and negative integers, as users may input such data.

### Scenario 4: Average of Single Integer
Details:
  TestName: test_average_of_single_integer
  Description: Verify that the function correctly calculates the average when given a single integer.
Execution:
  Arrange: Simulate user input of "5".
  Act: Call the `average` function.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is 5.0.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of ensuring that the function handles the edge case of a single input correctly.

### Scenario 5: Average of Zeroes
Details:
  TestName: test_average_of_zeroes
  Description: Verify that the function correctly calculates the average when all inputs are zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Simulate user input of "0 0 0 0 0".
  Act: Call the `average` function.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is 0.0.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of ensuring that the function handles zeroes correctly, as they are valid inputs.

### Scenario 6: Average of Large Numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_average_of_large_numbers
  Description: Verify that the function correctly calculates the average of very large integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Simulate user input of "1000000000 2000000000 3000000000".
  Act: Call the `average` function.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is 2000000000.0.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of ensuring that the function correctly handles large numbers, as users may input such values.

### Scenario 7: Average with Empty Input
Details:
  TestName: test_average_with_empty_input
  Description: Verify that the function handles the case where no input is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Simulate user input of an empty string "".
  Act: Call the `average` function.
  Assert: Expect an exception to be raised (e.g., ValueError).
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of ensuring that the function gracefully handles empty input, which is an edge case.

### Scenario 8: Average with Non-Numeric Input
Details:
  TestName: test_average_with_non_numeric_input
  Description: Verify that the function handles the case where non-numeric input is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Simulate user input of "a b c".
  Act: Call the `average` function.
  Assert: Expect an exception to be raised (e.g., ValueError).
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of ensuring that the function gracefully handles non-numeric input, which is an invalid input scenario.

### Scenario 9: Average with Floating Point Numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_average_with_floating_point_numbers
  Description: Verify that the function handles the case where floating-point numbers are provided as input.
Execution:
  Arrange: Simulate user input of "1.5 2.5 3.5".
  Act: Call the `average` function.
  Assert: Expect an exception to be raised (e.g., ValueError due to invalid integer conversion).
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of ensuring that the function handles floating-point input appropriately, as users may mistakenly enter such values.

### Scenario 10: Average with Mixed Valid and Invalid Input
Details:
  TestName: test_average_with_mixed_valid_and_invalid_input
  Description: Verify that the function handles the case where both valid and invalid inputs are provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Simulate user input of "1 2 a 4".
  Act: Call the `average` function.
  Assert: Expect an exception to be raised (e.g., ValueError).
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of ensuring that the function handles mixed valid and invalid input gracefully, as users may input such data.

These test scenarios should provide a comprehensive coverage of the `average` function's expected behavior, edge cases, and error conditions.
