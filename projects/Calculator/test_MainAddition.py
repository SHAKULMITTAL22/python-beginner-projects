Sure, here are the test scenarios for the `addition` function:

### Scenario 1: Test with Positive Integers
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_with_positive_integers
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly adds a series of positive integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the input to simulate the user entering "1 2 3 4 5".
  Act: Call the `addition` function.
  Assert: Check if the result is 15.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function can correctly sum positive integers, which is a common use case.

### Scenario 2: Test with Negative Integers
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_with_negative_integers
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly adds a series of negative integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the input to simulate the user entering "-1 -2 -3 -4 -5".
  Act: Call the `addition` function.
  Assert: Check if the result is -15.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function can handle and correctly sum negative integers.

### Scenario 3: Test with Mixed Positive and Negative Integers
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_with_mixed_integers
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly adds a mixture of positive and negative integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the input to simulate the user entering "1 -2 3 -4 5".
  Act: Call the `addition` function.
  Assert: Check if the result is 3.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function can handle and correctly sum a mixture of positive and negative integers.

### Scenario 4: Test with Zero
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_with_zero
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly handles zeros in the input.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the input to simulate the user entering "0 0 0".
  Act: Call the `addition` function.
  Assert: Check if the result is 0.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function can correctly handle and sum zeros.

### Scenario 5: Test with Single Number
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_with_single_number
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly handles a single number input.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the input to simulate the user entering "5".
  Act: Call the `addition` function.
  Assert: Check if the result is 5.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function can correctly handle and return a single number input.

### Scenario 6: Test with Large Numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_with_large_numbers
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly handles very large numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the input to simulate the user entering "1000000 2000000 3000000".
  Act: Call the `addition` function.
  Assert: Check if the result is 6000000.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function can handle and correctly sum large numbers.

### Scenario 7: Test with No Input
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_with_no_input
  Description: This test verifies that the function handles the case where no input is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the input to simulate the user entering an empty string.
  Act: Call the `addition` function.
  Assert: Check if the function raises a ValueError or returns 0.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function handles the edge case of no input gracefully.

### Scenario 8: Test with Non-numeric Input
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_with_non_numeric_input
  Description: This test verifies that the function handles non-numeric input appropriately.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the input to simulate the user entering "a b c".
  Act: Call the `addition` function.
  Assert: Check if the function raises a ValueError.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function can handle invalid input and raises an appropriate error.

### Scenario 9: Test with Mixed Numeric and Non-numeric Input
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_with_mixed_numeric_and_non_numeric_input
  Description: This test verifies that the function handles mixed numeric and non-numeric input appropriately.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the input to simulate the user entering "1 2 a".
  Act: Call the `addition` function.
  Assert: Check if the function raises a ValueError.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function can handle mixed valid and invalid input and raises an appropriate error.

### Scenario 10: Test with Leading and Trailing Spaces
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_with_leading_and_trailing_spaces
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly handles input with leading and trailing spaces.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the input to simulate the user entering " 1 2 3 ".
  Act: Call the `addition` function.
  Assert: Check if the result is 6.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function can handle and correctly sum input with leading and trailing spaces.

These scenarios cover a comprehensive set of cases to validate the business logic of the `addition` function, ensuring it handles typical, edge, and erroneous inputs effectively.
