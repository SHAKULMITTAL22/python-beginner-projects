================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The function 'addition' does not validate or sanitize the user's input which can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes.
Solution: Implement input validation to ensure that the user is entering a series of integers separated by spaces. You can use Python's built-in exception handling to catch any errors when attempting to convert the user's input to integers.

Vulnerability: CWE-676: Use of Potentially Dangerous Function
Issue: The 'input' function is used, which can pose a security risk as it can potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.
Solution: Avoid using the 'input' function where possible. If user interaction is necessary, consider using a more secure method to gather input, such as reading from a file or using a GUI input dialog.

Vulnerability: CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release
Issue: The imported 'os' and 'time' modules are not used in the current code which can consume extra resources.
Solution: Remove unnecessary imports to free up system resources and reduce the potential attack surface.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Valid input numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_valid_input
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function correctly adds up the numbers entered by the user.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock up the user input to be a string of numbers separated by spaces.
  Act: Invoke the addition function.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is the correct sum of the entered numbers.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function performs its main purpose correctly, which is to add up the numbers entered by the user. The expected result is directly related to the function's specifications and business requirements.

Scenario 2: Empty input
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_empty_input
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function handles the case where the user does not enter any numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock up the user input to be an empty string.
  Act: Invoke the addition function.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is 0.
Validation:
  This test is important because it checks how the function handles edge cases. The function should still return a valid result (0) even when no numbers are entered.

Scenario 3: Negative numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_negative_numbers
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function correctly adds up negative numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock up the user input to be a string of negative numbers separated by spaces.
  Act: Invoke the addition function.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is the correct sum of the entered numbers.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function correctly handles negative numbers. The expected result is directly related to the function's specifications and business requirements.

Scenario 4: Non-integer numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_non_integer_numbers
  Description: This test is intended to verify that the function correctly handles non-integer numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock up the user input to be a string of non-integer numbers separated by spaces.
  Act: Invoke the addition function.
  Assert: Check that the function raises a ValueError.
Validation:
  This test is important because it checks how the function handles error conditions. The function should raise a ValueError when non-integer numbers are entered, as per the business requirements.
