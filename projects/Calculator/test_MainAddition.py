================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The input from the user is not validated. If non-numeric input is provided, the program will raise a ValueError and potentially crash.
Solution: Implement input validation to ensure that the user input consists only of numbers separated by spaces. Use try-except blocks to handle invalid input gracefully.

Vulnerability: CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')
Issue: The code imports the 'os' module but does not use it. If future code additions use 'os.system' with user input, it could lead to command injection vulnerabilities.
Solution: Remove unnecessary imports or ensure that any use of the 'os' module does not involve user input, or use safer alternatives such as the 'subprocess' module with proper input sanitization.

Vulnerability: CWE-89: SQL Injection
Issue: Although there is no direct SQL interaction in the current code, the pattern of taking raw user input without validation can lead to SQL injection if database operations are added in the future.
Solution: Always validate and sanitize user input before using it in any database queries. Use parameterized queries or ORM libraries to prevent SQL injection.

Vulnerability: CWE-319: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information
Issue: If the application were to be extended to transmit user input over a network, the current approach does not ensure that sensitive data is encrypted during transmission.
Solution: Use secure communication protocols such as HTTPS for transmitting any sensitive information to prevent eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Validate that the function correctly adds multiple positive integers.
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_with_multiple_positive_integers
  Description: Verify that the function correctly sums a series of positive integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the input to simulate user entering "1 2 3 4 5".
  Act: Call the addition function.
  Assert: Check that the return value is 15.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function can correctly handle and sum multiple positive integers as expected.

Scenario 2: Validate that the function correctly adds multiple negative integers.
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_with_multiple_negative_integers
  Description: Verify that the function correctly sums a series of negative integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the input to simulate user entering "-1 -2 -3 -4 -5".
  Act: Call the addition function.
  Assert: Check that the return value is -15.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly handles and sums multiple negative integers, adhering to the expected business logic.

Scenario 3: Validate that the function correctly adds a mix of positive and negative integers.
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_with_mixed_integers
  Description: Verify that the function correctly sums a mix of positive and negative integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the input to simulate user entering "1 -2 3 -4 5".
  Act: Call the addition function.
  Assert: Check that the return value is 3.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function can handle a mix of positive and negative integers and correctly calculate their sum.

Scenario 4: Validate that the function returns zero when all inputs are zero.
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_with_all_zeros
  Description: Verify that the function returns zero when all input numbers are zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the input to simulate user entering "0 0 0 0 0".
  Act: Call the addition function.
  Assert: Check that the return value is 0.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly handles a series of zeros and returns the correct sum, which is zero.

Scenario 5: Validate that the function correctly adds a single number.
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_with_single_number
  Description: Verify that the function correctly returns the number itself when only one number is input.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the input to simulate user entering "42".
  Act: Call the addition function.
  Assert: Check that the return value is 42.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly handles the case where only one number is input and returns that number as the sum.

Scenario 6: Validate that the function handles a large input of numbers.
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_with_large_input
  Description: Verify that the function can handle and correctly sum a large number of inputs.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the input to simulate user entering a large sequence of numbers, such as "1 2 3 ... 1000".
  Act: Call the addition function.
  Assert: Check that the return value is the correct sum of the sequence.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function is capable of handling and summing a large number of inputs efficiently and correctly.

Scenario 7: Validate that the function handles an empty input.
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_with_empty_input
  Description: Verify that the function handles an empty input gracefully.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the input to simulate user entering an empty string.
  Act: Call the addition function.
  Assert: Check that the function raises an appropriate exception or returns a specific value indicating an empty input.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function can handle edge cases where the user provides no input, and it behaves as expected in such scenarios.

Scenario 8: Validate that the function handles non-integer inputs gracefully.
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_with_non_integer_inputs
  Description: Verify that the function raises an appropriate exception when non-integer inputs are provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the input to simulate user entering "1 a 3".
  Act: Call the addition function.
  Assert: Check that the function raises a ValueError or another appropriate exception.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function can handle invalid inputs gracefully and raises appropriate exceptions to signal the error.

Scenario 9: Validate that the function handles large integer values.
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_with_large_integers
  Description: Verify that the function correctly adds very large integer values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the input to simulate user entering large integer values such as "999999999 888888888".
  Act: Call the addition function.
  Assert: Check that the return value is the correct sum of the large integers.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function can handle and correctly sum very large integer values, which is important for robustness and correctness in various business scenarios.
