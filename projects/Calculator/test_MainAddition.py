================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Uncontrolled Input (CWE-20)
Issue: The function 'addition' uses the 'input' function to get data from the user. This can be exploited to perform arbitrary code execution if the input is not validated or sanitized.
Solution: Avoid using the 'input' function to get data from the user. Instead, use command line arguments, environment variables, or other safer methods to get user input. If 'input' must be used, ensure to validate and sanitize the input data.

Vulnerability: Unused Imports (CWE-116)
Issue: The 'os' and 'time' modules are imported but not used in the code. This is not a security issue per se, but it's a bad practice that can lead to confusion and potential errors.
Solution: Remove unused imports to keep the code clean and understandable. This will also help to reduce the attack surface.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test with valid numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_with_valid_numbers
  Description: This test verifies if the addition function correctly adds up the numbers entered by the user.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock up the user input to return a string of numbers separated by spaces.
  Act: Invoke the addition function.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is the expected sum of the numbers.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function correctly performs its main task of adding up numbers. The expected result is the correct sum of the numbers, which is the function's main business requirement.

Scenario 2: Test with negative numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_with_negative_numbers
  Description: This test verifies if the addition function correctly handles negative numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock up the user input to return a string of negative numbers separated by spaces.
  Act: Invoke the addition function.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is the expected sum of the numbers.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function correctly handles negative numbers. The expected result is the correct sum of the numbers, which is a requirement for any addition function.

Scenario 3: Test with zero
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_with_zero
  Description: This test verifies if the addition function correctly handles zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock up the user input to return a string containing zero and other numbers separated by spaces.
  Act: Invoke the addition function.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is the expected sum of the numbers.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function correctly handles zero. The expected result is the correct sum of the numbers, which should not be affected by the presence of zero.

Scenario 4: Test with no numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_with_no_numbers
  Description: This test verifies if the addition function correctly handles an input with no numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock up the user input to return an empty string.
  Act: Invoke the addition function.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is zero.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function correctly handles an empty input. The expected result is zero, which is the sum of no numbers.

Scenario 5: Test with large numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_with_large_numbers
  Description: This test verifies if the addition function can handle large numbers without overflow.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock up the user input to return a string of large numbers separated by spaces.
  Act: Invoke the addition function.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is the expected sum of the numbers.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that the function can handle large numbers. The expected result is the correct sum of the numbers, which verifies that the function does not overflow with large inputs.
