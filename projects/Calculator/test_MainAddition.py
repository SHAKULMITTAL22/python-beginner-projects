Sure, here are the test scenarios for the given `addition` function:

### Scenario 1: Adding multiple positive integers
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_multiple_positive_integers
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly adds multiple positive integers entered by the user.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the input to simulate user entering "1 2 3 4 5".
  Act: Invoke the `addition` function.
  Assert: Check that the result is 15.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly processes multiple positive integers, which is a common use case.

### Scenario 2: Adding multiple negative integers
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_multiple_negative_integers
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly adds multiple negative integers entered by the user.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the input to simulate user entering "-1 -2 -3 -4 -5".
  Act: Invoke the `addition` function.
  Assert: Check that the result is -15.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function handles negative integers properly, which is important for validating the correctness of the logic.

### Scenario 3: Adding a mix of positive and negative integers
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_mixed_integers
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly adds a mix of positive and negative integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the input to simulate user entering "10 -2 3 -4".
  Act: Invoke the `addition` function.
  Assert: Check that the result is 7.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function can handle and correctly sum a mix of positive and negative integers.

### Scenario 4: Adding a single integer
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_single_integer
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly returns the value of a single entered integer.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the input to simulate user entering "42".
  Act: Invoke the `addition` function.
  Assert: Check that the result is 42.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function can handle the simplest case of a single integer input.

### Scenario 5: Adding integers including zero
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_including_zero
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly includes zero in the addition.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the input to simulate user entering "0 1 2 3".
  Act: Invoke the `addition` function.
  Assert: Check that the result is 6.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly processes zero, which is important for ensuring comprehensive functionality.

### Scenario 6: Adding no input (empty string)
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_no_input
  Description: This test verifies that the function handles the case when no input is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the input to simulate user entering an empty string.
  Act: Invoke the `addition` function.
  Assert: Check that the function handles this gracefully, possibly by returning 0 or raising an appropriate exception.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function can handle edge cases where no input is provided, which is important for robustness.

### Scenario 7: Adding very large integers
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_large_integers
  Description: This test verifies that the function can handle the addition of very large integers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the input to simulate user entering "1000000000 2000000000".
  Act: Invoke the `addition` function.
  Assert: Check that the result is 3000000000.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function can handle large integers, which is important for users dealing with large numerical data.

### Scenario 8: Adding integers with leading and trailing spaces
Details:
  TestName: test_addition_with_spaces
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly trims leading and trailing spaces from the input.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the input to simulate user entering " 1 2 3 ".
  Act: Invoke the `addition` function.
  Assert: Check that the result is 6.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly handles and trims spaces, which is important for user input flexibility.
