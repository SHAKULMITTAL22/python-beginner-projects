================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Uncontrolled Format String (CWE-134)
Issue: The use of Python's input() function can lead to potential security risks, as it can allow for the execution of arbitrary code.
Solution: Replace the input() function with raw_input() in Python 2.x versions or use a more secure method of getting user input, such as using an argument parser for command line scripts.

Vulnerability: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') (CWE-79)
Issue: The use of float(input()) without proper validation can lead to type conversion errors if the user input is not a valid float. This can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes.
Solution: Add error handling or input validation to check if the user input is a valid float before attempting to convert it.

Vulnerability: Improper Input Validation (CWE-20)
Issue: The subtraction() function does not validate that n_1 is greater than n_2 before subtracting. This can lead to negative results, which may not be expected or desired.
Solution: Add input validation to check that n_1 is greater than n_2 before subtracting, or handle negative results appropriately.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Normal Subtraction
Details:
  TestName: test_normal_subtraction
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly subtracts the second number from the first when both numbers are positive. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the input to return two positive numbers, e.g. 8 and 5.
  Act: Call the function subtraction.
  Assert: Check that the output is equal to the expected result (3 in this case).
Validation:
  The test ensures that the basic functionality of the subtraction function is working correctly. It's important because it confirms that the function can handle typical use cases.

Scenario 2: Subtraction with Zero
Details:
  TestName: test_subtraction_with_zero
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly handles cases where one of the numbers is zero. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the input to return a positive number and zero, e.g. 7 and 0.
  Act: Call the function subtraction.
  Assert: Check that the output is equal to the first number (7 in this case).
Validation:
  This test validates the function's ability to handle edge cases where one of the numbers is zero. It's important to ensure that the function correctly handles such cases, as zero is a common input in subtraction operations.

Scenario 3: Negative Result Subtraction
Details:
  TestName: test_negative_result_subtraction
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly handles cases where the result of the subtraction is negative.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the input to return two numbers, e.g. 5 and 8, where the second number is greater than the first.
  Act: Call the function subtraction.
  Assert: Check that the output is equal to the expected negative result (-3 in this case).
Validation:
  This test confirms that the function can handle cases where the result of the subtraction is negative. It's important because negative results are a common occurrence in subtraction operations.

Scenario 4: Subtraction with Negative Numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_subtraction_with_negative_numbers
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly handles cases where one or both of the numbers are negative. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the input to return two numbers, e.g. -3 and -5.
  Act: Call the function subtraction.
  Assert: Check that the output is equal to the expected result (2 in this case).
Validation:
  This test validates the function's ability to handle cases where one or both of the input numbers are negative. It's important to ensure that the function correctly handles such cases, as negative numbers are common inputs in subtraction operations. 

Scenario 5: Subtraction with Floating Point Numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_subtraction_with_floating_point_numbers
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly handles cases where one or both of the numbers are floating point numbers. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the input to return two numbers, e.g. 3.5 and 1.2.
  Act: Call the function subtraction.
  Assert: Check that the output is equal to the expected result (2.3 in this case).
Validation:
  This test validates the function's ability to handle cases where one or both of the input numbers are floating point numbers. It's important because floating point numbers are common inputs in subtraction operations.
