### Test Scenarios for the `subtraction` Function

#### Scenario 1: Subtracting two positive numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_subtracting_positive_numbers
  Description: Verify that the function correctly subtracts the second positive number from the first positive number.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock input to provide two positive numbers.
  Act: Call the subtraction function.
  Assert: Check that the result is the difference between the first and the second number.
Validation:
  Rationalizing the importance of this test ensures that the basic functionality of subtraction is working as expected when both inputs are positive, which is a common use case.

#### Scenario 2: Subtracting a larger number from a smaller number
Details:
  TestName: test_subtracting_larger_from_smaller
  Description: Ensure that the function can handle and correctly subtract when the second number is larger than the first number.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock input to provide a smaller number followed by a larger number.
  Act: Call the subtraction function.
  Assert: Confirm that the result is a negative number representing the correct difference.
Validation:
  This test is crucial for confirming that the function correctly handles cases where the result of subtraction is negative, an essential aspect of subtraction logic.

#### Scenario 3: Subtracting two negative numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_subtracting_negative_numbers
  Description: Verify that the subtraction function correctly handles subtraction when both inputs are negative.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock inputs to provide two negative numbers.
  Act: Call the subtraction function.
  Assert: Check that the result is the difference which should also be negative if the second number is more negative than the first.
Validation:
  Testing with negative numbers ensures that the function performs correctly in scenarios involving negative values, which is crucial for comprehensive function validation.

#### Scenario 4: Subtracting zero from a number
Details:
  TestName: test_subtracting_zero_from_number
  Description: Ensure that subtracting zero from any number returns the original number.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock inputs to provide zero as the second number and any other number as the first.
  Act: Call the subtraction function.
  Assert: Verify that the result is the first number itself.
Validation:
  It's fundamental to verify subtraction identity properties, where subtracting zero should not alter the original number.

#### Scenario 5: Subtracting a number from itself
Details:
  TestName: test_subtracting_number_from_itself
  Description: Verify that subtracting a number from itself results in zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock input to provide the same number for both inputs.
  Act: Call the subtraction function.
  Assert: Check that the result is zero.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function adheres to the mathematical property that a number minus itself should always result in zero.

### BEGIN_GUIDELINE
- **Correctness**: Ensure that the function returns the correct subtraction result for a variety of input pairs. This includes positive, negative, and zero values. Use mocking to simulate user input during testing.
- **Boundary Conditions**: Test the function with extreme values, including very large and very small numbers, to ensure that it handles all possible float values without error.
- **Error Handling**: While the scenario explicitly avoids testing varying input data types, it's still important to ensure that inputs which can be converted to float do not cause unexpected behavior. Use mocking to simulate these inputs.
- **Performance**: Although performance is usually not critical for simple arithmetic operations, if the function is adapted for high-precision or large-scale computations, stress tests might be necessary.
- **Security**: Ensure that the function does not expose any security vulnerabilities through its inputs. Given the current structure, focus on ensuring that input handling (via mocking in tests) does not introduce breaches.
