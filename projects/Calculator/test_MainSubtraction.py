Here are the test scenarios for the `subtraction` function:

### Scenario 1: Subtraction of Two Positive Numbers
**Details:**
  - **TestName:** test_subtraction_positive_numbers
  - **Description:** This test verifies that the function correctly subtracts two positive numbers, ensuring that basic arithmetic operations are handled as expected.

**Execution:**
  - **Arrange:** Simulate user input to provide two positive numbers, e.g., 10 and 5.
  - **Act:** Invoke the `subtraction` function.
  - **Assert:** Check that the result is 5, which is the difference between 10 and 5.

**Validation:**
  - This test is crucial to confirm that the function correctly performs subtraction for basic positive numbers, which is a fundamental operation for its intended use.

### Scenario 2: Subtraction of a Larger Number from a Smaller Number
**Details:**
  - **TestName:** test_subtraction_larger_from_smaller
  - **Description:** This test checks if the function handles cases where the second number is larger than the first, resulting in a negative outcome.

**Execution:**
  - **Arrange:** Simulate user input to provide two numbers where the second is larger, e.g., 3 and 10.
  - **Act:** Invoke the `subtraction` function.
  - **Assert:** Verify that the result is -7, which is the correct difference.

**Validation:**
  - This scenario is important to ensure the function correctly calculates negative results, which are valid and expected in subtraction.

### Scenario 3: Subtraction Resulting in Zero
**Details:**
  - **TestName:** test_subtraction_resulting_in_zero
  - **Description:** This test checks if the function returns zero when both input numbers are equal.

**Execution:**
  - **Arrange:** Simulate user input to provide two equal numbers, e.g., 8 and 8.
  - **Act:** Invoke the `subtraction` function.
  - **Assert:** Confirm that the result is 0.

**Validation:**
  - Ensuring that equal numbers result in zero is critical for the correctness of the subtraction logic.

### Scenario 4: Subtraction with Negative Numbers
**Details:**
  - **TestName:** test_subtraction_with_negative_numbers
  - **Description:** This test evaluates the function's ability to handle negative numbers, both as minuends and subtrahends.

**Execution:**
  - **Arrange:** Simulate user input for scenarios such as -5 and -3, and -3 and -5.
  - **Act:** Invoke the `subtraction` function.
  - **Assert:** Verify the results are -2 for the first pair and 2 for the second pair.

**Validation:**
  - Handling negative numbers is essential for comprehensive arithmetic operations, which this test ensures.

### Scenario 5: Subtraction with Floating Point Numbers
**Details:**
  - **TestName:** test_subtraction_floating_point_numbers
  - **Description:** This test checks if the function accurately handles floating-point arithmetic, which can introduce precision issues.

**Execution:**
  - **Arrange:** Simulate user input for two floating-point numbers, e.g., 5.5 and 2.2.
  - **Act:** Invoke the `subtraction` function.
  - **Assert:** Verify that the result is 3.3, considering potential floating-point precision limitations.

**Validation:**
  - Floating-point precision is a common issue in computations, and this test ensures the function handles it appropriately.

### Scenario 6: Subtraction with Zero
**Details:**
  - **TestName:** test_subtraction_with_zero
  - **Description:** This test ensures that subtracting zero from a number and vice versa is handled correctly.

**Execution:**
  - **Arrange:** Simulate user input for scenarios such as 10 and 0, and 0 and 10.
  - **Act:** Invoke the `subtraction` function.
  - **Assert:** Confirm the results are 10 for the first pair and -10 for the second pair.

**Validation:**
  - This test ensures the function correctly implements the identity property of subtraction, which is critical for mathematical accuracy.
