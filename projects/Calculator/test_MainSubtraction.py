Here are the test scenarios for the `subtraction` function:

### Scenario 1: Subtraction of Two Positive Numbers
**Details:**
  - **TestName:** test_subtraction_positive_numbers
  - **Description:** This test verifies that the function correctly subtracts two positive numbers, ensuring that basic arithmetic operations are handled as expected.

**Execution:**
  - **Arrange:** Simulate user input to provide two positive numbers, e.g., 10 and 5.
  - **Act:** Invoke the `subtraction` function.
  - **Assert:** Check that the result is 5, which is the expected outcome.

**Validation:**
  - This test is crucial as it confirms the core functionality of the subtraction operation for positive numbers, which is a fundamental use case.

### Scenario 2: Subtraction Resulting in Zero
**Details:**
  - **TestName:** test_subtraction_resulting_in_zero
  - **Description:** This test checks if the function correctly handles cases where the two numbers are equal, resulting in zero.

**Execution:**
  - **Arrange:** Simulate user input to provide two equal numbers, e.g., 7 and 7.
  - **Act:** Invoke the `subtraction` function.
  - **Assert:** Verify that the result is 0.

**Validation:**
  - Testing for zero is important as it ensures that the function can handle edge cases where the result is a neutral element.

### Scenario 3: Subtraction of Negative Numbers
**Details:**
  - **TestName:** test_subtraction_negative_numbers
  - **Description:** This test ensures that the function correctly subtracts negative numbers, which should result in adding their absolute values.

**Execution:**
  - **Arrange:** Simulate user input to provide two negative numbers, e.g., -3 and -2.
  - **Act:** Invoke the `subtraction` function.
  - **Assert:** Confirm that the result is -1, since -3 - (-2) equals -1.

**Validation:**
  - This test is essential to verify that the function handles negative number arithmetic correctly, which can be a common scenario.

### Scenario 4: Subtraction with Mixed Sign Numbers
**Details:**
  - **TestName:** test_subtraction_mixed_sign_numbers
  - **Description:** This test checks the function's ability to handle subtraction where one number is positive and the other is negative.

**Execution:**
  - **Arrange:** Simulate user input for a positive and a negative number, e.g., 4 and -3.
  - **Act:** Invoke the `subtraction` function.
  - **Assert:** Ensure that the result is 7, as subtracting a negative is equivalent to addition.

**Validation:**
  - This scenario tests the function's handling of mixed-sign inputs, which is crucial for real-world applications involving both gains and losses.

### Scenario 5: Subtraction Resulting in Negative
**Details:**
  - **TestName:** test_subtraction_resulting_in_negative
  - **Description:** This test verifies that the function correctly computes results that are negative when the second number is larger than the first.

**Execution:**
  - **Arrange:** Simulate user input to provide two numbers where the second is larger, e.g., 3 and 5.
  - **Act:** Invoke the `subtraction` function.
  - **Assert:** Check that the result is -2.

**Validation:**
  - This test is significant because it ensures that the function returns negative results correctly, which is a valid outcome in mathematical operations.

### Scenario 6: Subtraction with Floating Point Numbers
**Details:**
  - **TestName:** test_subtraction_floating_point_numbers
  - **Description:** This test assesses the function's ability to accurately handle and return results for floating point numbers.

**Execution:**
  - **Arrange:** Simulate user input for two floating-point numbers, e.g., 5.75 and 2.25.
  - **Act:** Invoke the `subtraction` function.
  - **Assert:** Ensure that the result is 3.5.

**Validation:**
  - Floating-point arithmetic can be prone to precision issues, so this test ensures that the function handles such cases appropriately.

These scenarios collectively cover a broad range of possible inputs and ensure the function performs correctly across various arithmetic situations.
