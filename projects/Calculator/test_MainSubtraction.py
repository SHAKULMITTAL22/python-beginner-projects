================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Uncontrolled Format String (CWE-134)
Issue: The use of Python's input() function can lead to potential security risks. An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code or commands by providing specially crafted input.
Solution: Replace the use of the input() function with a safer alternative, or sanitize the input before use. For example, if you only expect numeric input, ensure the input is a number before using it.

Vulnerability: Use of Insufficiently Random Values (CWE-330)
Issue: If the subtraction function is used in a context where the result should be unpredictable (e.g., as part of a cryptographic algorithm), the predictability of Python's default random number generator could pose a security risk.
Solution: If random values are needed, use a secure random number generator such as os.urandom() or secrets.SystemRandom().

Vulnerability: Inclusion of Functionality from Untrusted Control Sphere (CWE-829)
Issue: The code imports the os and time modules but does not use them, which could lead to unnecessary risks if future code unintentionally uses these potentially dangerous modules.
Solution: Remove unused imports to minimize potential attack surface.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Normal Subtraction
Details:
  TestName: test_normal_subtraction
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly subtracts the second number from the first when both numbers are positive.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the input function to return two positive numbers.
  Act: Invoke the subtraction function.
  Assert: Check that the function returns the correct difference of the two numbers.
Validation:
  This test checks the basic functionality of the subtraction function. The expected result is that the function correctly subtracts the second number from the first.

Scenario 2: Subtraction Resulting in Negative Number
Details:
  TestName: test_subtraction_resulting_in_negative
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly returns a negative number when the second number is larger than the first.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the input function to return two numbers, where the second number is larger than the first.
  Act: Invoke the subtraction function.
  Assert: Check that the function returns a negative number.
Validation:
  This test checks the function's ability to handle cases where the second number is larger than the first. The expected result is that the function correctly returns a negative number.

Scenario 3: Subtraction with Zero
Details:
  TestName: test_subtraction_with_zero
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly handles cases where one or both of the numbers are zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the input function to return zero and another number.
  Act: Invoke the subtraction function.
  Assert: Check that the function returns the correct difference of the two numbers.
Validation:
  This test checks the function's ability to handle cases where one or both of the numbers are zero. The expected result is that the function correctly subtracts zero from a number and a number from zero.

Scenario 4: Subtraction with Negative Numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_subtraction_with_negative_numbers
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly subtracts when one or both numbers are negative.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the input function to return one or two negative numbers.
  Act: Invoke the subtraction function.
  Assert: Check that the function returns the correct difference of the two numbers.
Validation:
  This test checks the function's ability to handle cases where one or both of the numbers are negative. The expected result is that the function correctly subtracts the second number from the first, even when they are negative.

Scenario 5: Subtraction with Floating Point Numbers
Details:
  TestName: test_subtraction_with_floating_point_numbers
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly subtracts when one or both numbers are floating point numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the input function to return one or two floating point numbers.
  Act: Invoke the subtraction function.
  Assert: Check that the function returns the correct difference of the two numbers.
Validation:
  This test checks the function's ability to handle cases where one or both of the numbers are floating point numbers. The expected result is that the function correctly subtracts the second number from the first, even when they are floating point numbers.
