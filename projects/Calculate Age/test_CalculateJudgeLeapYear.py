### Test Scenarios for `judge_leap_year` Function

#### Scenario 1: Test with a year that is a typical leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_typical_leap_year
  Description: Verify that the function returns True for a year that is divisible by 4 but not by 100, which is a standard rule for leap years.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year(2024).
  Assert: Check that the return value is True.
Validation:
  This test verifies the core functionality of identifying a standard leap year, ensuring that the function adheres to the Gregorian calendar rules.

#### Scenario 2: Test with a century year that is not a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_non_leap_century
  Description: Ensure that the function returns False for a year that is divisible by 100 but not by 400, following the leap year exception rule.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year(1900).
  Assert: Check that the return value is False.
Validation:
  Validates the function's ability to correctly apply leap year rules to century years, which are typically exceptions in the leap year calculation.

#### Scenario 3: Test with a year that is a leap year and a century year
Details:
  TestName: test_leap_century_year
  Description: Confirm that the function returns True for a year divisible by both 100 and 400.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year(2000).
  Assert: Check that the return value is True.
Validation:
  Important to ensure the function can correctly identify the special case of century years that are also leap years, adhering to the full leap year rule.

#### Scenario 4: Test with a common year
Details:
  TestName: test_common_year
  Description: Test that the function returns False for a typical common year that is not divisible by 4.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year(2023).
  Assert: Check that the return value is False.
Validation:
  Ensures that the function correctly identifies most common years, which are not leap years, reinforcing its reliability for basic scenarios.

#### Scenario 5: Test with the minimal edge case of year input
Details:
  TestName: test_minimal_year_input
  Description: Verify the function's behavior with the smallest input value expected to be handled correctly by the function.
Execution:
  Arrange: No special setup required.
  Act: Call judge_leap_year(1).
  Assert: Check that the return value is False.
Validation:
  This test checks the function's robustness in handling unusually small year values, ensuring it handles such edge cases gracefully.
