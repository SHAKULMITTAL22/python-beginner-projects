### Test Scenarios for `month_days` Function

#### Scenario 1: Test with typical month having 31 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_31_days
  Description: Verify if the function returns 31 days for months which typically have 31 days, regardless of the year being a leap year or not.
Execution:
  Arrange: None needed.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter as 1 (January) and leap_year as False.
  Assert: Check if the function returns 31.
Validation:
  This test validates that the function correctly identifies months typically having 31 days and returns the correct number of days. It ensures the function performs as expected under standard conditions.

#### Scenario 2: Test with typical month having 30 days
Details:
  TestName: test_month_with_30_days
  Description: Verify if the function returns 30 days for months which typically have 30 days.
Execution:
  Arrange: None needed.
  Act: Call `month_days` with the month parameter as 4 (April) and leap_year as True.
  Assert: Check if the function returns 30.
Validation:
  This test checks the correct behavior of the function for months that have 30 days. It is important to ensure the accuracy of days calculation across all months.

#### Scenario 3: Test February in a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_in_leap_year
  Description: Ensure that the function returns 29 days for February when the year is a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None needed.
  Act: Call `month_days` with month as 2 and leap_year as True.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns 29.
Validation:
  This test is crucial for validating the function's ability to correctly handle the special case of February in leap years, which is essential for date-related calculations in applications.

#### Scenario 4: Test February in a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_in_non_leap_year
  Description: Check that the function returns 28 days for February when the year is not a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: None needed.
  Act: Call `month_days` with month as 2 and leap_year as False.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns 28.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function properly calculates the days in February for non-leap years, which is critical for correctness in date handling.

#### Scenario 5: Test with invalid month value
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_month_value
  Description: Validate the function's behavior when provided with an invalid month number.
Execution:
  Arrange: None needed.
  Act: Call `month_days` with month as 13 (an invalid month) and leap_year as True.
  Assert: Check how the function handles this input or if it throws an error.
Validation:
  This test checks the function's robustness and error handling capabilities when faced with invalid input, ensuring the function's reliability.
