### Test Scenarios for `month_days` Function

#### Scenario 1: Test with months having 31 days
Details:
  TestName: test_months_with_31_days
  Description: Verify that the function returns 31 days for months that traditionally have 31 days (January, March, May, July, August, October, December).
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a list of months with 31 days.
  Act: Loop through each month and call `month_days(month, leap_year=False)`.
  Assert: Check that the result is 31 for each month.
Validation:
  Rationalizing the importance of this test ensures that the function correctly identifies months with 31 days, which is crucial for accurate date-related operations.

#### Scenario 2: Test with months having 30 days
Details:
  TestName: test_months_with_30_days
  Description: Ensure the function returns 30 days for months that traditionally have 30 days (April, June, September, November).
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a list of months with 30 days.
  Act: Loop through each month and call `month_days(month, leap_year=False)`.
  Assert: Check that the result is 30 for each month.
Validation:
  This test verifies the function's capability to handle months with 30 days, which is essential for calendar and scheduling applications.

#### Scenario 3: Test February in a leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_in_leap_year
  Description: Confirm that the function returns 29 days for February when the year is a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set `leap_year=True`.
  Act: Call `month_days(2, leap_year=True)`.
  Assert: Verify that the result is 29.
Validation:
  Testing February during a leap year is critical to ensure the function adheres to leap year rules, impacting any date calculations for such years.

#### Scenario 4: Test February in a non-leap year
Details:
  TestName: test_february_in_non_leap_year
  Description: Check that the function returns 28 days for February when the year is not a leap year.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set `leap_year=False`.
  Act: Call `month_days(2, leap_year=False)`.
  Assert: Verify that the result is 28.
Validation:
  This test is crucial for validating the function's accuracy in non-leap years, affecting all date-related functionalities for February.

#### Scenario 5: Test with invalid month values
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_month_values
  Description: Ensures that the function handles invalid month inputs gracefully.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a list of invalid month values, e.g., 0, 13, -1.
  Act: Loop through each invalid month and call `month_days(month, leap_year=False)`.
  Assert: Check for exceptions or default handling of undefined behavior.
Validation:
  This test ensures robustness and error handling in the function, preventing unexpected behavior in the application.
