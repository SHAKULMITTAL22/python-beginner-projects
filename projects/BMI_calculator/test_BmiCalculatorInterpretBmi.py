```
Scenario 1: Handling None input for BMI
Details:
  TestName: test_bmi_none_input
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly handles a None input by returning an appropriate error message.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call interpret_bmi with None as the argument.
  Assert: Check if the return value is "Invalid input. Height should be greater than 0."
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of the test by ensuring the function gracefully handles null input, which is a common error scenario.

Scenario 2: BMI indicating underweight
Details:
  TestName: test_bmi_underweight
  Description: Validates that the function correctly identifies and classifies an underweight BMI.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a BMI value of 18.4 (just below the threshold for underweight).
  Act: Call interpret_bmi with this BMI value.
  Assert: Check if the return message correctly identifies the BMI as underweight.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function adheres to the correct classification standards for BMI and returns accurate health advice.

Scenario 3: BMI at the boundary of underweight and normal weight
Details:
  TestName: test_bmi_boundary_underweight_normal
  Description: Tests the function's response at the critical boundary between underweight and normal weight.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a BMI value of 18.5.
  Act: Call interpret_bmi with this BMI value.
  Assert: Check if the function still classifies the BMI as normal weight.
Validation:
  Testing boundary conditions ensures that the function correctly interprets BMI values at critical thresholds, which is essential for accurate health assessments.

Scenario 4: BMI indicating normal weight
Details:
  TestName: test_bmi_normal_weight
  Description: Ensures the function correctly classifies a normal weight BMI.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a BMI value of 22 (well within the normal range).
  Act: Call interpret_bmi with this BMI value.
  Assert: Verify the message states that the BMI is normal.
Validation:
  Confirms that the function properly classifies typical cases and provides confidence in its everyday accuracy.

Scenario 5: BMI indicating overweight
Details:
  TestName: test_bmi_overweight
  Description: Checks if the function correctly classifies an overweight BMI.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a BMI value of 28.
  Act: Call interpret_bmi with this BMI value.
  Assert: Ensure the message correctly indicates an overweight classification.
Validation:
  Validates that the function provides correct health warnings for overweight individuals, which is crucial for preventive health measures.

Scenario 6: BMI indicating Class I obesity
Details:
  TestName: test_bmi_obesity_class_i
  Description: Tests the function's ability to classify Class I obesity accurately.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a BMI value of 32.
  Act: Call interpret_bmi with this BMI value.
  Assert: Confirm the message indicates Class I obesity.
Validation:
  Ensures that the function meets clinical guidelines for obesity classification, which is vital for appropriate medical advice.

Scenario 7: BMI indicating Class III obesity (extreme case)
Details:
  TestName: test_bmi_obesity_class_iii
  Description: Verifies that the function correctly classifies extreme obesity (Class III).
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a BMI value of 40 or higher.
  Act: Call interpret_bmi with this BMI value.
  Assert: Check if the message correctly identifies the BMI as Class III obesity.
Validation:
  This test checks the function's capability to handle extreme values accurately, which is crucial for managing severe health risks.

BEGIN_GUIDELINE
  - **Correctness**: Ensure that the function returns the correct classification message for a range of BMI values covering all categories including boundary values.
  - **Boundary Conditions**: Test the function with BMI values right on the boundary points of different classifications to ensure it categorizes them correctly.
  - **Error Handling**: Verify that the function handles None input gracefully, returning an appropriate error message.
  - **Performance**: While performance is not a primary concern for this function due to its simplicity and the small size of input, it's generally good practice to check the function's response time, ensuring it performs well under typical usage scenarios.
  - **Security**: Given the function's straightforward nature and lack of external interactions, security concerns are minimal. However, ensuring that the function handles unexpected or malicious inputs gracefully (like extremely large numbers or unexpected data types) is advisable.
END_GUIDELINE
