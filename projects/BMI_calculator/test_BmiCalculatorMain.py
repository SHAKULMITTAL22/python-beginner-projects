### Test Scenarios for the `main` function

#### Scenario 1: Valid Input for Normal BMI
Details:
  TestName: test_main_with_valid_normal_bmi
  Description: Test the main function with valid height and weight inputs that result in a normal BMI classification.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the input for height and weight to simulate user input of valid numerical values.
  Act: Execute the `main` function.
  Assert: Check that the output includes a message indicating a normal BMI.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of this test by affirming that the function correctly calculates and interprets BMI for common cases, adhering to expected health standards.

#### Scenario 2: Invalid Input Types
Details:
  TestName: test_main_with_invalid_input_types
  Description: Test the main function with invalid input types to verify error handling.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the input for height and weight to simulate user input of non-numerical values.
  Act: Execute the `main` function.
  Assert: Check that the output includes "Invalid input. Please enter numerical values for height and weight."
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function gracefully handles non-numeric input, providing user-friendly error messages.

#### Scenario 3: Zero Height Input
Details:
  TestName: test_main_with_zero_height
  Description: Test the main function with a height input of zero to verify handling of a divide by zero scenario.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the input for height as zero and a valid weight.
  Act: Execute the `main` function.
  Assert: Check that the output includes "Invalid input. Height should be greater than 0."
Validation:
  Validates the function's ability to handle edge cases where height is zero, which would normally lead to a mathematical error.

#### Scenario 4: Extremely High BMI
Details:
  TestName: test_main_with_extremely_high_bmi
  Description: Test the main function with inputs that result in an extremely high BMI to verify the upper classification.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the input for height and weight to simulate a very low height and very high weight.
  Act: Execute the `main` function.
  Assert: Check that the output correctly classifies the BMI as obese (Class III).
Validation:
  Ensures the function accurately classifies extremely high BMI values, critical for medical advisories.

#### Scenario 5: Negative Inputs
Details:
  TestName: test_main_with_negative_inputs
  Description: Test the main function with negative values for height and weight to verify handling.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock the input for height and weight to simulate negative values.
  Act: Execute the `main` function.
  Assert: Check for an error message or an invalid BMI classification.
Validation:
  Tests the function's robustness against invalid input values that could potentially cause calculation errors or incorrect classifications.

### Test Guidelines
BEGIN_GUIDELINE
**Correctness**: Ensure that each test scenario correctly simulates the environment and inputs as they would occur in actual usage. Verify that outputs strictly match expected results based on known BMI classifications.

**Boundary Conditions**: Include tests that push the extremes of input values (both low and high), as well as zero and negative values, to ensure that the function behaves correctly at limits.

**Error Handling**: Specifically verify how the function handles non-numeric inputs, zero height, and unexpected characters or symbols in inputs, ensuring that errors are gracefully managed.

**Performance**: While performance might not be critical for this function given its simplicity, consider testing with multiple simultaneous inputs if applicable, to simulate stress conditions.

**Security**: As the function reads from a CSV file and takes user input, ensure that inputs are properly sanitized to prevent injection attacks or errors. This includes validating against potential CSV injection if applicable.
END_GUIDELINE

These scenarios and guidelines should provide comprehensive coverage of the `main` function's behavior, ensuring functionality, reliability, and user experience are maintained across a wide range of conditions.
