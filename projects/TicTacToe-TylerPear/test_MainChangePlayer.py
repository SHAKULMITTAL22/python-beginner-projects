================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Syntax Error
Issue: The code contains syntax errors due to incorrect string delimitation and misplaced commas, which will prevent the script from executing.
Solution: Correct the syntax by ensuring proper string delimitation and removing unnecessary commas. Use proper Python multi-line string syntax for the function definition.

Vulnerability: Code Clarity and Maintenance
Issue: The function 'change_player' uses magic numbers without explanation, which can make the code hard to understand and maintain.
Solution: Replace the magic numbers with named constants that explain their purpose. For example, define constants like PLAYER_ONE = 1 and PLAYER_TWO = 0 at the beginning of the module.

================================================================================

### Scenario 1: Test with an even input number
Details:
  TestName: test_change_player_with_even_number
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly returns "O" when an even number is passed as input.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call the function change_player with an even number, such as 2.
  Assert: Check if the returned value is "O".
Validation:
  Rationalizing the importance of this test is based on the function’s requirement to return "O" for even numbers, thereby ensuring the function behaves correctly under expected conditions.

### Scenario 2: Test with an odd input number
Details:
  TestName: test_change_player_with_odd_number
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly returns "X" when an odd number is passed as input.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call the function change_player with an odd number, such as 3.
  Assert: Check if the returned value is "X".
Validation:
  This test is crucial to confirm that the function adheres to its specification of returning "X" for odd numbers, which is a fundamental aspect of its business logic.

### Scenario 3: Test with zero as input
Details:
  TestName: test_change_player_with_zero
  Description: This test checks that the function returns "O" when 0 is passed as input, considering 0 as an even number.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call the function change_player with 0.
  Assert: Check if the returned value is "O".
Validation:
  Testing with 0 is essential as it is a boundary value for even numbers. Ensuring correct behavior for this input validates the function's handling of edge cases.

### Scenario 4: Test with a large even number
Details:
  TestName: test_change_player_with_large_even_number
  Description: This test ensures that the function handles large even numbers correctly by returning "O".
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call the function change_player with a large even number, such as 10000.
  Assert: Check if the returned value is "O".
Validation:
  Testing with large even numbers checks the function's robustness and confirms that the logic holds true regardless of the magnitude of the input.

### Scenario 5: Test with a large odd number
Details:
  TestName: test_change_player_with_large_odd_number
  Description: This test ensures that the function handles large odd numbers correctly by returning "X".
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call the function change_player with a large odd number, such as 10001.
  Assert: Check if the returned value is "X".
Validation:
  This scenario tests the function’s ability to consistently apply its logic to odd numbers at higher ranges, ensuring scalability and stability of the implementation.

### Scenario 6: Test with negative even number
Details:
  TestName: test_change_player_with_negative_even_number
  Description: This test checks that the function returns "O" for negative even numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call the function change_player with a negative even number like -2.
  Assert: Check if the returned value is "O".
Validation:
  It’s important to verify that the function correctly handles negative even numbers, as this can be a common use case in some game scenarios, ensuring broad applicability.

### Scenario 7: Test with negative odd number
Details:
  TestName: test_change_player_with_negative_odd_number
  Description: This test checks that the function returns "X" for negative odd numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call the function change_player with a negative odd number like -3.
  Assert: Check if the returned value is "X".
Validation:
  This test ensures that negative odd values are handled correctly, which is crucial for maintaining consistent behavior across all possible integer inputs.
