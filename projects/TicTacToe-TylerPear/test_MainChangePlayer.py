Based on the provided `change_player` function, here are comprehensive test scenarios:

Scenario 1: Return "O" for Even Input
Details:
  TestName: test_change_player_even_input
  Description: Verify that the function returns "O" when given an even number as input.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call change_player(2)
  Assert: Check if the returned value is "O"
Validation:
  This test ensures the core functionality of the function for even inputs, which is a fundamental requirement of the alternating player logic.

Scenario 2: Return "X" for Odd Input
Details:
  TestName: test_change_player_odd_input
  Description: Verify that the function returns "X" when given an odd number as input.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call change_player(1)
  Assert: Check if the returned value is "X"
Validation:
  This test confirms the function's behavior for odd inputs, complementing the even input test and ensuring the alternating pattern is maintained.

Scenario 3: Consistent Output for Multiple Even Inputs
Details:
  TestName: test_change_player_multiple_even_inputs
  Description: Ensure the function consistently returns "O" for different even numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a list of even numbers (e.g., [0, 2, 4, 100])
  Act: Call change_player() with each number in the list
  Assert: Verify that all results are "O"
Validation:
  This test checks the consistency of the function's behavior across various even inputs, reinforcing the reliability of the player alternation logic.

Scenario 4: Consistent Output for Multiple Odd Inputs
Details:
  TestName: test_change_player_multiple_odd_inputs
  Description: Ensure the function consistently returns "X" for different odd numbers.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a list of odd numbers (e.g., [1, 3, 5, 101])
  Act: Call change_player() with each number in the list
  Assert: Verify that all results are "X"
Validation:
  This test ensures consistency for odd inputs, complementing the even input consistency test and further validating the alternation pattern.

Scenario 5: Alternating Output for Sequential Inputs
Details:
  TestName: test_change_player_alternating_sequence
  Description: Verify that the function alternates between "X" and "O" for a sequence of inputs.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare a sequence of numbers (e.g., range(10))
  Act: Call change_player() with each number in the sequence
  Assert: Check that the results alternate between "X" and "O"
Validation:
  This test simulates a game scenario where the function is called repeatedly, ensuring the alternating pattern is maintained throughout a sequence of turns.

Scenario 6: Handling Zero Input
Details:
  TestName: test_change_player_zero_input
  Description: Confirm that the function treats zero as an even number and returns "O".
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific setup required.
  Act: Call change_player(0)
  Assert: Verify that the result is "O"
Validation:
  This test addresses the edge case of zero input, ensuring it's correctly classified as even and maintains the expected behavior of the function.

Scenario 7: Handling Large Number Inputs
Details:
  TestName: test_change_player_large_numbers
  Description: Ensure the function correctly handles very large number inputs.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare very large even and odd numbers
  Act: Call change_player() with these large numbers
  Assert: Verify that large even numbers return "O" and large odd numbers return "X"
Validation:
  This test checks the function's ability to handle extreme inputs, ensuring the modulo operation works correctly for large numbers without overflow or unexpected behavior.

Scenario 8: Handling Negative Number Inputs
Details:
  TestName: test_change_player_negative_numbers
  Description: Verify that the function correctly processes negative number inputs.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare negative even and odd numbers
  Act: Call change_player() with these negative numbers
  Assert: Confirm that negative even numbers return "O" and negative odd numbers return "X"
Validation:
  This test ensures the function's modulo operation works correctly with negative numbers, maintaining consistent behavior across the entire integer range.

These scenarios cover a wide range of test cases for the `change_player` function, including normal operation, edge cases, and potential extreme inputs. They focus on validating the core business logic of alternating between players based on even and odd inputs.
