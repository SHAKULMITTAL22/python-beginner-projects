================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Recursion
Issue: The recursive call in change_board can lead to a stack overflow if the recursion is not controlled or limited, especially with continuous invalid moves.
Solution: Implement a loop to handle retries instead of recursion, or introduce a recursion depth counter to prevent excessive recursion.

Vulnerability: Input Validation
Issue: The function does not validate the 'move' input, which could lead to incorrect behavior or errors if invalid move strings are provided.
Solution: Add explicit checks to validate the 'move' input against expected values before processing it.

Vulnerability: Code Injection
Issue: Using f-string for dynamic expression in examine_move can be risky if not properly sanitized, potentially allowing for code injection if 'player' variable is tampered.
Solution: Ensure that the 'player' variable is strictly controlled or sanitized to prevent injection. Use constant values or enumeration for player identifiers.

================================================================================

### Scenario 1: Test Successful Placement in Top Left
Details:
  TestName: test_successful_placement_top_left
  Description: Tests if the player's mark is successfully placed in the top left (TL) of the board when it is empty.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a 2D list representing an empty Tic-Tac-Toe board and specify the player's mark.
  Act: Call the `change_board` function with the move "TL", the board, and the player's mark.
  Assert: Check that the top left of the board contains the player's mark.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly handles placing a mark in an empty space. It verifies that the board updates correctly based on valid input, adhering to the game's rules.

### Scenario 2: Test Move on Occupied Spot
Details:
  TestName: test_move_on_occupied_spot
  Description: Tests the function's response when a move is attempted on an already occupied spot.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a board with the top middle (TM) already occupied by a player's mark. Set up the game for the other player.
  Act: Call the `change_board` function with the move "TM", the occupied board, and the second player's mark.
  Assert: Check that the board remains unchanged and that the function prompts for a different move.
Validation:
  This test is crucial for maintaining game integrity by ensuring that players cannot overwrite each other's moves. It tests the function's ability to detect occupied spaces and handle them appropriately.

### Scenario 3: Test Valid Move After Attempting Invalid Move
Details:
  TestName: test_valid_move_after_invalid
  Description: Verifies that after an invalid move (occupied spot), the player can successfully make a valid move.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a board where the bottom right (BR) is occupied, and other spots are free. Prepare to first attempt an occupied spot then a valid one.
  Act: Simulate an attempt to move on "BR" and then on "TR" after being prompted.
  Assert: Check that the "TR" now contains the new mark and "BR" remains unchanged.
Validation:
  This scenario tests the game's resilience and correctness in user interactions, ensuring that the game progresses correctly even after handling errors.

### Scenario 4: Test Entire Board Filled Without Winner
Details:
  TestName: test_board_filled_no_winner
  Description: Ensures that the game correctly identifies a full board without any winning condition.
Execution:
  Arrange: Fill the board in such a way that all spaces are taken but there is no winner.
  Act: Attempt to make a move on any spot.
  Assert: Verify that the function does not allow the move and prompts for another spot.
Validation:
  Important for ensuring the game can correctly identify draw conditions and prevent further moves when the game should be over.

### Scenario 5: Test Move on Nonexistent Position
Details:
  TestName: test_move_on_nonexistent_position
  Description: Ensures the game handles cases where the move is not recognized (e.g., a typo or invalid command).
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a typical game state.
  Act: Attempt to make a move using an invalid command like "XX".
  Assert: Check that the game prompts for a correct move without altering the board.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the game gracefully handles user input errors by prompting for valid moves, thereby maintaining game state integrity and user experience.

Each scenario focuses on critical aspects of the game's logic and user interaction, ensuring comprehensive coverage and robustness of the `change_board` function.
