================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The input function is used to re-prompt the user for a move if the spot is taken. This input is not validated, making it susceptible to unexpected or malicious input.
Solution: Implement input validation to ensure the user-provided move is a valid board position and handle invalid inputs gracefully.

Vulnerability: CWE-570: Expression is Always True
Issue: The 'if taken:' condition could potentially lead to infinite recursion if the user keeps selecting taken spots, resulting in a stack overflow.
Solution: Implement a maximum number of retries or handle the situation differently to avoid infinite recursion.

Vulnerability: CWE-703: Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions
Issue: The examine_move function call is not surrounded by any error handling code. If examine_move throws an exception, this could lead to the program crashing.
Solution: Add try-except blocks around the examine_move function calls to handle potential exceptions and ensure the program can fail gracefully.

Vulnerability: CWE-398: Indicator of Poor Code Quality
Issue: The code contains unnecessary comments and misaligned string literals, which can lead to confusion and maintenance difficulties.
Solution: Remove unnecessary comments and align string literals properly to improve code readability and maintainability.

================================================================================

### Scenario 1: Player successfully places a mark on an empty spot

**Details:**
  **TestName:** test_place_mark_on_empty_spot
  **Description:** Verify that a player can successfully place their mark on an empty spot on the board.

**Execution:**
  **Arrange:** Initialize a board with all empty spots and set the move to "TL" for player "X".
  **Act:** Call `change_board("TL", board, "X")`.
  **Assert:** Check that the top-left spot on the board now contains " X|".

**Validation:**
  This test ensures that the function correctly updates the board when a player makes a valid move, which is fundamental to the game's functionality.

### Scenario 2: Attempt to place a mark on an already taken spot

**Details:**
  **TestName:** test_place_mark_on_taken_spot
  **Description:** Verify that the function handles attempts to place a mark on a spot that is already taken.

**Execution:**
  **Arrange:** Initialize a board with the top-left spot already taken by "X" and set the move to "TL" for player "O".
  **Act:** Call `change_board("TL", board, "O")`.
  **Assert:** Check that the board remains unchanged and that the function prompts for a new move.

**Validation:**
  This test confirms that the function prevents overwriting a spot that has already been taken, maintaining the game's integrity.

### Scenario 3: Player places a mark on the middle row, left column

**Details:**
  **TestName:** test_place_mark_middle_row_left
  **Description:** Verify that a player can place their mark on the middle row, left column.

**Execution:**
  **Arrange:** Initialize a board with all empty spots and set the move to "ML" for player "O".
  **Act:** Call `change_board("ML", board, "O")`.
  **Assert:** Check that the middle-left spot on the board now contains " O|".

**Validation:**
  This test ensures that the function correctly handles moves to the middle row, left column, which is a valid move scenario.

### Scenario 4: Player places a mark on the bottom row, right column

**Details:**
  **TestName:** test_place_mark_bottom_row_right
  **Description:** Verify that a player can place their mark on the bottom row, right column.

**Execution:**
  **Arrange:** Initialize a board with all empty spots and set the move to "BR" for player "X".
  **Act:** Call `change_board("BR", board, "X")`.
  **Assert:** Check that the bottom-right spot on the board now contains "X".

**Validation:**
  This test ensures that the function correctly handles moves to the bottom row, right column, which is another valid move scenario.

### Scenario 5: Invalid move input should prompt for a new move

**Details:**
  **TestName:** test_invalid_move_input
  **Description:** Verify that the function prompts for a new move when an invalid move is provided.

**Execution:**
  **Arrange:** Initialize a board with all empty spots and set an invalid move (e.g., "INVALID") for player "X".
  **Act:** Call `change_board("INVALID", board, "X")`.
  **Assert:** Check that the function prompts for a new move.

**Validation:**
  This test ensures that the function can handle invalid move inputs gracefully by prompting the user for a valid move, maintaining the game's usability.

### Scenario 6: Player places a mark on the top row, middle column

**Details:**
  **TestName:** test_place_mark_top_row_middle
  **Description:** Verify that a player can place their mark on the top row, middle column.

**Execution:**
  **Arrange:** Initialize a board with all empty spots and set the move to "TM" for player "O".
  **Act:** Call `change_board("TM", board, "O")`.
  **Assert:** Check that the top-middle spot on the board now contains " O | ".

**Validation:**
  This test ensures that the function correctly handles moves to the top row, middle column, which is a valid move scenario.

### Scenario 7: Player places a mark on the middle row, right column

**Details:**
  **TestName:** test_place_mark_middle_row_right
  **Description:** Verify that a player can place their mark on the middle row, right column.

**Execution:**
  **Arrange:** Initialize a board with all empty spots and set the move to "MR" for player "X".
  **Act:** Call `change_board("MR", board, "X")`.
  **Assert:** Check that the middle-right spot on the board now contains "X".

**Validation:**
  This test ensures that the function correctly handles moves to the middle row, right column, which is another valid move scenario.

### Scenario 8: Recursive call with valid new move after an initial taken spot

**Details:**
  **TestName:** test_recursive_call_after_taken_spot
  **Description:** Verify that after attempting to place a mark on a taken spot, the function correctly handles a subsequent valid move.

**Execution:**
  **Arrange:** Initialize a board with the top-left spot taken by "X" and set the initial move to "TL" for player "O". Mock the input to provide a new valid move (e.g., "TM").
  **Act:** Call `change_board("TL", board, "O")`.
  **Assert:** Check that the top-middle spot on the board now contains " O | ".

**Validation:**
  This test ensures that the function can handle recursive calls and correctly process a valid new move after an initial attempt on a taken spot, maintaining the game's flow and logic.
