Based on the provided function `change_board` and its dependencies, here are pytest test scenarios focusing on validating the business logic:

Scenario 1: Valid Move on Empty Board
Details:
  TestName: test_valid_move_empty_board
  Description: Verify that a valid move on an empty board correctly updates the board state.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an empty 5x3 board.
  Act: Call change_board with move "TL", the empty board, and player "X".
  Assert: Check if the board has been updated with "X" in the top-left position.
Validation:
  This test ensures the basic functionality of placing a mark on an empty board works as expected.

Scenario 2: Attempt to Move on Occupied Position
Details:
  TestName: test_move_on_occupied_position
  Description: Verify that attempting to move on an already occupied position prompts for a new move.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a board with "X" in the top-left position.
  Act: Call change_board with move "TL", the pre-populated board, and player "O".
  Assert: Verify that the function prompts for a new move and the board remains unchanged.
Validation:
  This test ensures the function correctly handles attempts to play on an already occupied position.

Scenario 3: Multiple Valid Moves
Details:
  TestName: test_multiple_valid_moves
  Description: Verify that multiple valid moves correctly update the board state.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an empty 5x3 board.
  Act: Call change_board multiple times with different valid moves for both players.
  Assert: Check if the board reflects all the moves correctly.
Validation:
  This test ensures the function can handle a sequence of valid moves, updating the board correctly each time.

Scenario 4: All Board Positions
Details:
  TestName: test_all_board_positions
  Description: Verify that moves can be made on all valid board positions.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an empty 5x3 board.
  Act: Call change_board for each valid move (TL, TM, TR, ML, MM, MR, BL, BM, BR).
  Assert: Check if all positions on the board are correctly filled.
Validation:
  This test ensures that all valid move inputs are correctly processed and update the appropriate board positions.

Scenario 5: Alternating Players
Details:
  TestName: test_alternating_players
  Description: Verify that the function correctly handles moves from alternating players.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an empty 5x3 board.
  Act: Call change_board alternating between players "X" and "O" for multiple moves.
  Assert: Check if the board correctly reflects the moves of both players.
Validation:
  This test ensures the function can handle moves from different players, maintaining the integrity of the game state.

Scenario 6: Invalid Move Input
Details:
  TestName: test_invalid_move_input
  Description: Verify that the function handles invalid move inputs appropriately.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an empty 5x3 board.
  Act: Call change_board with an invalid move input.
  Assert: Check if the function handles the invalid input gracefully (e.g., by prompting for a new move).
Validation:
  This test ensures the function can handle unexpected or invalid move inputs without crashing or corrupting the game state.

Scenario 7: Full Board
Details:
  TestName: test_full_board
  Description: Verify the behavior of the function when the board is completely filled.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a board that is completely filled with moves.
  Act: Attempt to make a move on the full board.
  Assert: Verify that the function recognizes the board is full and handles it appropriately.
Validation:
  This test ensures the function can handle the edge case of a completely filled board, which might occur at the end of a game.

These scenarios cover the main aspects of the `change_board` function's behavior, including valid moves, occupied positions, multiple moves, all board positions, alternating players, invalid inputs, and a full board situation. They focus on the business logic and expected behavior of the function in various game situations.
