================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The function 'print_board' does not validate if the 'board' variable is defined or has the correct structure before using it, which can lead to NameError or IndexError.
Solution: Ensure that 'board' is defined and validate its structure (e.g., it should be a list of lists with at least 5 sublists, each containing at least 3 elements) before attempting to access its elements.

Vulnerability: undefined
Issue: The function assumes the 'board' variable always has sufficient rows and columns (5x3 matrix). If 'board' does not meet this assumption, accessing non-existent indexes could cause an IndexError.
Solution: Add checks to confirm the size of the 'board' matrix before accessing its elements, and handle cases where the board size is different appropriately.

Vulnerability: CWE-532: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File
Issue: If the 'board' array contains sensitive information, printing it directly to the console could expose this information in logs or screen captures.
Solution: Avoid direct logging of sensitive information. If the board must be printed, ensure that sensitive data is sanitized or masked before output.

================================================================================

### Scenario 1: Printing a fully populated board
Details:
  TestName: test_print_board_fully_populated
  Description: Tests the function's ability to correctly print a board that is fully populated with values, ensuring that all rows and columns are displayed as expected.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a `board` variable with distinct values in all positions to make output checking straightforward.
  Act: Call `print_board()` function.
  Assert: Capture the output and verify that it matches the expected format and content for a fully populated board.
Validation:
  This test validates that the `print_board` function correctly handles a typical use case where the board is fully populated with data. It checks the function's ability to format the output correctly, which is crucial for user understanding in applications using this board display.

### Scenario 2: Printing an empty board
Details:
  TestName: test_print_board_empty
  Description: Tests the function's ability to handle and correctly print an empty board, where all cells are initialized to a default empty value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a `board` variable with the same empty value (like None or empty string) in all positions.
  Act: Call `print_board()` function.
  Assert: Capture the output and verify that it matches the expected format for an empty board, with all positions showing the empty value.
Validation:
  This test ensures that `print_board` can handle the edge case of an empty board, which is essential for new games or reset states in board-based games. It tests the function's robustness in handling minimal data.

### Scenario 3: Printing a board with mixed values
Details:
  TestName: test_print_board_mixed_values
  Description: Tests the function's ability to print a board that contains a mix of populated and empty values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a `board` variable with a mix of filled and empty values.
  Act: Call `print_board()` function.
  Assert: Capture the output and verify that it correctly reflects the mix of values, maintaining proper format and spacing.
Validation:
  This scenario checks the function's flexibility in handling boards that are not uniformly filled. It's important for ongoing games where some positions are filled while others remain empty, ensuring the function's versatility.

### Scenario 4: Verifying the newline at the end of the board
Details:
  TestName: test_print_board_end_newline
  Description: Ensures that there is a newline character at the end of the final board line, which is important for formatting when multiple outputs follow each other.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a `board` with any valid configuration.
  Act: Call `print_board()` function.
  Assert: Check that the output ends with two newline characters (`\n\n`), confirming correct end formatting.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the board display is properly separated from subsequent content in the output, which is essential for clear visual separation in console applications or logs.

### Scenario 5: Print board with special characters
Details:
  TestName: test_print_board_special_characters
  Description: Verify that the board can handle and correctly display special characters or non-alphanumeric content.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a `board` variable with special characters or emojis in some positions.
  Act: Call `print_board()` function.
  Assert: Capture the output and verify that the special characters are displayed correctly.
Validation:
  This test ensures that `print_board` can handle special characters, which might be used for visually distinct player markers or other customizations in board-based games, thus enhancing the function's usability in diverse scenarios.
