Based on the provided `examine_move` function, here are comprehensive test scenarios:

Scenario 1: Move on an Empty Cell
Details:
  TestName: test_move_on_empty_cell
  Description: Verify that a move on an empty cell is accepted and updates the board correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an empty 3x3 board.
  Act: Call examine_move with valid coordinates and a player symbol.
  Assert: Check that the function returns False (not taken) and the board is updated with the player's symbol.
Validation:
  This test ensures the basic functionality of placing a move on an empty cell works as expected.

Scenario 2: Move on an Occupied Cell
Details:
  TestName: test_move_on_occupied_cell
  Description: Confirm that a move on an already occupied cell is rejected.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a board with some cells already occupied.
  Act: Call examine_move with coordinates of an occupied cell.
  Assert: Verify that the function returns True (taken) and the board remains unchanged.
Validation:
  This test checks that the function correctly identifies and handles attempts to move on an already occupied cell.

Scenario 3: Move on the Edge of the Board
Details:
  TestName: test_move_on_board_edge
  Description: Ensure that moves on the edge of the board are processed correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an empty board.
  Act: Call examine_move with coordinates on the edge of the board.
  Assert: Check that the function returns False and updates the board correctly.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the function handles moves on the board's boundaries properly.

Scenario 4: Move in the Center of the Board
Details:
  TestName: test_move_in_board_center
  Description: Verify that a move in the center of the board is processed correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an empty board.
  Act: Call examine_move with coordinates for the center cell.
  Assert: Confirm that the function returns False and updates the center cell.
Validation:
  This test ensures that moves in the center of the board, often a strategic position, are handled correctly.

Scenario 5: Consecutive Moves by Different Players
Details:
  TestName: test_consecutive_moves_different_players
  Description: Check that the function correctly handles consecutive moves by different players.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an empty board.
  Act: Make two consecutive calls to examine_move with different player symbols.
  Assert: Verify that both moves are accepted (return False) and the board reflects both players' moves.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function correctly handles alternating moves between players.

Scenario 6: Attempt to Overwrite Existing Move
Details:
  TestName: test_attempt_to_overwrite_move
  Description: Confirm that the function prevents overwriting an existing move.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a board with some existing moves.
  Act: Call examine_move with coordinates of an existing move, but with a different player symbol.
  Assert: Check that the function returns True (taken) and the original move remains unchanged.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the integrity of existing moves is maintained and cannot be overwritten.

Scenario 7: Full Board Scenario
Details:
  TestName: test_move_on_full_board
  Description: Verify the behavior when attempting a move on a full board.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a board that is completely filled.
  Act: Call examine_move with any valid coordinates.
  Assert: Confirm that the function returns True (taken) for any cell and the board remains unchanged.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the function behaves correctly when the game board is full, which is an important edge case.

These scenarios cover a range of situations including basic functionality, edge cases, and potential error conditions, providing a comprehensive test suite for the `examine_move` function.
