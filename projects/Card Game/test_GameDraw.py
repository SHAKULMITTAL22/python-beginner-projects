Here are the test scenarios for the `draw` method using the `pytest` framework:

### Scenario 1: Verify Correct Output Format for Player Names and Cards
Details:
  TestName: test_draw_output_format
  Description: This test checks that the `draw` method outputs the player names and their respective cards in the correct format.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class containing the `draw` method. Prepare player names `p1n` and `p2n` and card values `p1c` and `p2c`.
  Act: Call the `draw` method with the prepared player names and card values.
  Assert: Capture the output and verify that it matches the expected format, e.g., "Player1 drew Card1 Player2 drew Card2".
Validation:
  This test is crucial to ensure that the method correctly formats its output, which is essential for user interface consistency and for maintaining clear game logs.

### Scenario 2: Test with Special Characters in Player Names
Details:
  TestName: test_draw_with_special_characters_in_names
  Description: This test ensures that the `draw` method can handle names with special characters gracefully, although special characters should be filtered out during initialization.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class with player names containing special characters, e.g., `p1n = "Player@1"`, `p2n = "Player#2"`. Assign valid card values `p1c` and `p2c`.
  Act: Call the `draw` method using these names and card values.
  Assert: Verify that the output does not include special characters in player names, assuming the initialization logic removes them.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure the robustness of the method in handling unexpected input, even though the constructor should prevent such cases.

### Scenario 3: Test with Empty Player Names
Details:
  TestName: test_draw_with_empty_names
  Description: This test checks how the `draw` method behaves when given empty strings as player names.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class with empty player names `p1n = ""`, `p2n = ""`. Assign valid card values `p1c` and `p2c`.
  Act: Call the `draw` method with these empty names.
  Assert: Verify that the output is formatted correctly, even with empty names, e.g., " drew Card1  drew Card2".
Validation:
  This test is significant for understanding the method's behavior with edge cases, ensuring that it handles empty input gracefully without crashing.

### Scenario 4: Test with Identical Player Names
Details:
  TestName: test_draw_with_identical_names
  Description: This test verifies that the `draw` method can handle scenarios where both players have the same name.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class with identical player names `p1n = "Player1"`, `p2n = "Player1"`. Assign distinct card values `p1c` and `p2c`.
  Act: Call the `draw` method using these names and card values.
  Assert: Verify that the output reflects the correct card associations with each player, despite the identical names.
Validation:
  This test is vital to ensure the method correctly distinguishes between players with the same name, which might be a rare but possible scenario in real applications.

### Scenario 5: Test with Numeric Card Values
Details:
  TestName: test_draw_with_numeric_card_values
  Description: This test checks the `draw` method's handling of numeric card values instead of strings.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class with valid player names `p1n = "Player1"`, `p2n = "Player2"`. Use numeric values for `p1c` and `p2c`, e.g., `p1c = 5`, `p2c = 10`.
  Act: Call the `draw` method with these parameters.
  Assert: Verify that the output correctly includes the numeric card values in the formatted string.
Validation:
  This test is essential to validate the method's flexibility in handling different data types for card values, ensuring that the output remains consistent regardless of input type.
