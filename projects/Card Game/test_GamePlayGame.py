Here's a set of test scenarios for the `play_game` function, following the specified format:

### Scenario 1: Game Ends When Cards Are Exhausted
**Details:**
- **TestName:** test_game_ends_when_cards_exhausted
- **Description:** This test verifies that the game ends when all cards are drawn from the deck, ensuring the function correctly handles the depletion of cards.

**Execution:**
- **Arrange:** Initialize the `play_game` class with a pre-defined `Deck` object containing a limited number of cards (e.g., 4 cards). Mock the `input` function to simulate continuous play until the deck is exhausted.
- **Act:** Invoke the `play_game` method.
- **Assert:** Check that the game ends with the "War is over" message and verify the winner is correctly determined based on the card draws.

**Validation:**
- **Rationale:** Ensures the game logic correctly identifies when the deck is empty and concludes the game, fulfilling the primary objective of managing card depletion.

### Scenario 2: Correct Winner is Announced
**Details:**
- **TestName:** test_correct_winner_announced
- **Description:** This test checks that the function correctly announces the winner based on the number of wins accumulated by each player.

**Execution:**
- **Arrange:** Use a `Deck` with a known sequence of cards that guarantees a specific player wins more rounds. Mock `input` to simulate play until all cards are drawn.
- **Act:** Call the `play_game` method.
- **Assert:** Verify that the final output announces the correct player as the winner, based on the predetermined card sequence.

**Validation:**
- **Rationale:** Confirms the function's core requirement to accurately track and declare the player with the most wins, ensuring fairness and correctness.

### Scenario 3: Game Can Be Quit Midway
**Details:**
- **TestName:** test_game_can_be_quit_midway
- **Description:** This test verifies that the game can be exited prematurely when the user inputs 'q', ensuring the function respects user control over game flow.

**Execution:**
- **Arrange:** Set up the game with a standard deck. Mock `input` to simulate a few rounds of play followed by a 'q' input.
- **Act:** Invoke `play_game`.
- **Assert:** Confirm that the game stops immediately after 'q' is inputted and no further rounds are played.

**Validation:**
- **Rationale:** Ensures user autonomy in controlling game duration, a critical aspect for user satisfaction and flexibility.

### Scenario 4: Handle Edge Case with Equal Cards
**Details:**
- **TestName:** test_handle_edge_case_with_equal_cards
- **Description:** This test ensures that when two drawn cards are equal, the game continues without incorrectly incrementing wins.

**Execution:**
- **Arrange:** Prepare a `Deck` with pairs of identical cards. Mock `input` for continuous play to test this scenario.
- **Act:** Run `play_game`.
- **Assert:** Check that neither player's win count increases when equal cards are drawn.

**Validation:**
- **Rationale:** Verifies the game's ability to handle ties correctly, which is crucial for maintaining game integrity.

### Scenario 5: No Special Characters in Player Names
**Details:**
- **TestName:** test_no_special_characters_in_player_names
- **Description:** Test verifies that player names are validated to exclude special characters, ensuring input integrity.

**Execution:**
- **Arrange:** Mock `input` to provide names with special characters, checking for re-prompting until valid names are entered.
- **Act:** Initialize the game, triggering name input.
- **Assert:** Ensure the prompt for valid names continues until names without special characters are provided.

**Validation:**
- **Rationale:** Maintains input quality and adheres to the precondition of valid naming conventions for players.
