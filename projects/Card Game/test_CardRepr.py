Scenario 1: Verify Correct String Representation of Card
Details:
  TestName: test_repr_returns_correct_card_representation
  Description: Ensure that the `__repr__` method returns a string representation of a card in the format "value of suit", verifying that the business logic of correctly mapping the card's value and suit is functioning as intended.
Execution:
  Arrange: 
    - Initialize a `Card` object (assuming a class named `Card` with attributes `value`, `suit`, `values`, and `suits`).
    - Mock or define `values` and `suits` attributes to contain valid card values and suits.
    - Set specific `value` and `suit` indices to test.
  Act: 
    - Call the `__repr__` method on the `Card` object.
  Assert: 
    - Check that the return value matches the expected string, e.g., "Ace of Spades".
Validation:
  Rationalize that this test ensures the core functionality of representing a card is correct and adheres to the expected format, which is crucial for any feature relying on card representation in user interfaces or logs.

Scenario 2: Handle Boundary Values for Card Representation
Details:
  TestName: test_repr_handles_boundary_card_values
  Description: Test the `__repr__` method's ability to handle boundary values for card indices, ensuring no out-of-bound errors occur.
Execution:
  Arrange: 
    - Create a `Card` object with `value` and `suit` set to the lower boundary (e.g., 0).
    - Define `values` and `suits` such that index 0 maps to valid card descriptions.
  Act: 
    - Invoke the `__repr__` method.
  Assert: 
    - Confirm that the output matches the expected string for these boundary values.
Validation:
  Ensure robustness of the card representation at boundary conditions, which is essential for preventing runtime errors in scenarios where card decks might be shuffled or accessed randomly.

Scenario 3: Ensure Representation with Invalid Indices Raises Error
Details:
  TestName: test_repr_raises_error_for_invalid_indices
  Description: Verify that the `__repr__` method raises an appropriate error when card indices are out of the valid range, ensuring safe handling of invalid states.
Execution:
  Arrange: 
    - Instantiate a `Card` object with `value` or `suit` indices outside the range of `values` or `suits`.
  Act: 
    - Call the `__repr__` method and expect it to raise an `IndexError`.
  Assert: 
    - Use pytest to check that the `IndexError` is raised.
Validation:
  Highlight the importance of error handling in maintaining the integrity of the card representation logic, preventing invalid states from causing unpredictable behavior.

Scenario 4: Verify Consistency Across Different Card Objects
Details:
  TestName: test_repr_consistency_across_card_instances
  Description: Ensure that different `Card` objects with the same `value` and `suit` indices return identical string representations, verifying the method's consistency.
Execution:
  Arrange: 
    - Create multiple `Card` objects with identical `value` and `suit` settings.
  Act: 
    - Call the `__repr__` method on each object.
  Assert: 
    - Check that all return the same string representation.
Validation:
  Reinforce the expectation of consistent behavior across instances, which is fundamental for scenarios involving comparisons or collections of card objects.

Scenario 5: Validate Representation with Custom Deck Configurations
Details:
  TestName: test_repr_with_custom_deck_values_and_suits
  Description: Test the `__repr__` method's flexibility and correctness when using customized `values` and `suits` mappings, beyond standard card decks.
Execution:
  Arrange: 
    - Initialize a `Card` object with a custom set of `values` and `suits`.
    - Assign specific `value` and `suit` indices relevant to the custom configuration.
  Act: 
    - Invoke the `__repr__` method.
  Assert: 
    - Confirm that the output string matches the expectation based on the custom configuration.
Validation:
  Demonstrate the method's adaptability to varied use cases, such as games with non-standard decks, enhancing the versatility of the card representation logic.
