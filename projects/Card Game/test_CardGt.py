Scenario 1: Validate Greater Value Comparison
Details:
  TestName: test_gt_greater_value
  Description: This test verifies that the `__gt__` method correctly identifies when one card's value is greater than another card's value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two card objects, `card1` and `card2`, where `card1.value` is greater than `card2.value`.
  Act: Invoke the `__gt__` method by comparing `card1 > card2`.
  Assert: The result should be `True`, indicating `card1` is greater than `card2`.
Validation:
  This test ensures the primary functionality of comparing card values is working correctly, which is crucial for any game logic relying on card rankings.

Scenario 2: Validate Equal Value and Greater Suit Comparison
Details:
  TestName: test_gt_equal_value_greater_suit
  Description: This test checks that the `__gt__` method correctly identifies when two cards have equal values but one has a greater suit.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two card objects, `card1` and `card2`, with equal `value` but `card1.suit` greater than `card2.suit`.
  Act: Invoke the `__gt__` method by comparing `card1 > card2`.
  Assert: The result should be `True`, indicating `card1` is greater due to its higher suit.
Validation:
  This test is important to ensure that when values are tied, the suit is used as a tiebreaker, which is a common rule in card games.

Scenario 3: Validate Equal Value and Suit
Details:
  TestName: test_gt_equal_value_and_suit
  Description: This test ensures that the `__gt__` method returns `False` when both the value and suit of two cards are equal.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two card objects, `card1` and `card2`, with identical `value` and `suit`.
  Act: Invoke the `__gt__` method by comparing `card1 > card2`.
  Assert: The result should be `False`, indicating neither card is greater.
Validation:
  It's important to verify that the method correctly handles equality, returning `False` when there is no advantage in either value or suit.

Scenario 4: Validate Lesser Value Comparison
Details:
  TestName: test_gt_lesser_value
  Description: This test checks that the `__gt__` method returns `False` when the first card's value is less than the second card's value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two card objects, `card1` and `card2`, where `card1.value` is less than `card2.value`.
  Act: Invoke the `__gt__` method by comparing `card1 > card2`.
  Assert: The result should be `False`, indicating `card1` is not greater than `card2`.
Validation:
  This scenario ensures the method accurately identifies when a card should not be considered greater due to a lower value.

Scenario 5: Validate Equal Value and Lesser Suit Comparison
Details:
  TestName: test_gt_equal_value_lesser_suit
  Description: This test ensures that the `__gt__` method correctly returns `False` when two cards have equal values, but the first card has a lesser suit.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two card objects, `card1` and `card2`, with equal `value` but `card1.suit` less than `card2.suit`.
  Act: Invoke the `__gt__` method by comparing `card1 > card2`.
  Assert: The result should be `False`, indicating `card1` is not greater than `card2`.
Validation:
  This scenario is crucial for verifying that the suit is only a tiebreaker when values are equal, and a lesser suit should not be considered greater.
