Here are some test scenarios for the `print_board` function using the `pytest` framework. These scenarios focus on validating the function's behavior under different conditions, considering the business logic and structure of the function.

### Scenario 1: Verify Correct Printing of a Standard Board
Details:
  TestName: test_print_standard_board
  Description: This test verifies that the function correctly prints a standard game board, which is represented as a 2D numpy array, by flipping it vertically.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a standard 6x7 game board with specific values to represent a typical Connect Four board.
  Act: Invoke `print_board` with the initialized board as a parameter.
  Assert: Capture the printed output and verify that it matches the vertically flipped version of the input board.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of ensuring that the function accurately represents the board's current state by flipping it correctly, which is crucial for displaying the game's progress to players.

### Scenario 2: Verify Behavior with an Empty Board
Details:
  TestName: test_print_empty_board
  Description: This test checks how the function handles an empty board, ensuring it flips and prints an empty board correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an empty board with dimensions 6x7 filled with zeros.
  Act: Call `print_board` with the empty board.
  Assert: Validate that the printed output is an empty board flipped vertically, which should still appear as an empty board.
Validation:
  Rationalize the need for this test to confirm that the function can handle and correctly display an empty board, a common starting point in many games.

### Scenario 3: Verify Functionality with a Non-Standard Sized Board
Details:
  TestName: test_print_non_standard_board
  Description: This test examines the function's ability to handle non-standard board sizes, ensuring it still prints correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a non-standard sized board, such as a 4x4 or 10x10 numpy array, with arbitrary values.
  Act: Use `print_board` to print the non-standard board.
  Assert: Check that the output matches the board flipped vertically, confirming the function's flexibility with different dimensions.
Validation:
  Rationalize the need for this test to ensure the function's robustness and adaptability to varying board sizes, which may be used in different game variants.

### Scenario 4: Verify Handling of Full Board
Details:
  TestName: test_print_full_board
  Description: This test ensures the function correctly handles a fully populated board, which represents a completed game state.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a fully populated board with alternating values (e.g., 1s and 2s) to simulate a completed game.
  Act: Call `print_board` with the full board.
  Assert: Validate the printed output to ensure it is the vertically flipped version of the fully populated board.
Validation:
  Rationalize the importance of this test to confirm that the function can accurately display a completed game state, crucial for game analysis or determining a winner.

### Scenario 5: Verify Handling of Irregular Values
Details:
  TestName: test_print_board_with_irregular_values
  Description: This test checks how the function manages a board containing irregular or unexpected values, ensuring it still prints correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a board with unexpected values, such as negative numbers or large integers.
  Act: Invoke `print_board` with the irregular board.
  Assert: Verify that the output is the board flipped vertically, checking for any errors or unexpected behavior.
Validation:
  Rationalize the need for this test to ensure the function's resilience against unexpected input values, maintaining consistent output and avoiding crashes.

These scenarios address different aspects of the `print_board` function's behavior, ensuring it operates correctly under various conditions. They focus on validating the business logic of flipping and printing the board, essential for maintaining accurate game representation.
