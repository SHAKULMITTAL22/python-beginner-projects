### Test Scenarios for the `main` function in a Loan Calculator Program

#### Scenario 1: Standard Loan Calculation
Details:
  TestName: test_standard_loan_calculation
  Description: Verify that the loan calculator correctly computes the monthly payment for standard input values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock inputs for `principal`, `annual_interest_rate`, and `months` with typical values, e.g., 10000.00 USD, 5% annual interest, and 12 months.
  Act: Run the `main` function.
  Assert: Check that the output correctly displays the calculated monthly payment based on the provided inputs.
Validation:
  The test ensures that the business logic for calculating monthly payments is correctly implemented and that the output is accurately formatted and displayed.

#### Scenario 2: Zero Interest Rate
Details:
  TestName: test_zero_interest_rate
  Description: Test the behavior of the loan calculation when the annual interest rate is 0%.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock inputs for `principal`, `annual_interest_rate` as 0, and `months`.
  Act: Run the `main` function.
  Assert: Verify that the monthly payment is simply the principal divided by the number of months.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the function gracefully handles an interest rate of 0%, a valid edge case in loan calculations.

#### Scenario 3: High Interest Rate
Details:
  TestName: test_high_interest_rate
  Description: Ensure that the calculator can handle unusually high interest rates without errors.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock inputs with a very high annual interest rate, e.g., 100%.
  Act: Run the `main` function.
  Assert: Confirm that the function returns a valid monthly payment without overflow or errors.
Validation:
  Testing high interest rates checks the robustness of the calculation formula and ensures stability under extreme conditions.

#### Scenario 4: Large Loan Term
Details:
  TestName: test_large_loan_term
  Description: Assess the function's performance and correctness over a significantly long loan term.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock inputs with a large number of months, e.g., 360 months (30 years).
  Act: Run the `main` function.
  Assert: Ensure that the monthly payment is calculated correctly and remains reasonable.
Validation:
  This test checks the precision and performance of the loan calculation over long periods, which is critical for mortgages and other long-term loans.

#### Scenario 5: Small Principal Amount
Details:
  TestName: test_small_principal_amount
  Description: Test the loan calculation logic with a very small principal amount.
Execution:
  Arrange: Mock inputs with a small principal amount, e.g., 100 USD.
  Act: Run the `main` function.
  Assert: Verify that the monthly payment is calculated correctly and is not rounded to zero prematurely.
Validation:
  Ensures that the calculator can handle small loan amounts accurately, which is important for micro-loans or short-term financing options.

BEGIN_GUIDELINE
**Correctness**:
- Ensure that for each test, the expected monthly payment is precisely calculated based on the formula provided. Use predefined inputs and compare against manually calculated results or results from a trusted financial calculator.

**Boundary Conditions**:
- Test with boundary values for `annual_interest_rate` such as 0% and very high percentages.
- Use minimal and maximal values for `principal` and `months` to verify behavior under extreme conditions.

**Error Handling**:
- While the main function does not directly handle errors in input types, ensure that the system remains robust against unexpected or edge-case inputs by testing these scenarios indirectly through mocked inputs.

**Performance**:
- Assess the function's execution time and resource usage with large input values, particularly for `months`, to ensure it performs efficiently in long-term loan scenarios.

**Security**:
- Verify that the function does not expose any sensitive data through errors or exceptions. Ensure that input handling functions (mocked in tests) sanitize and validate input effectively to prevent injection or overflow attacks.
END_GUIDELINE

These scenarios and guidelines provide a framework for ensuring that the `main` function in the loan calculator operates correctly, efficiently, and securely across a range of typical and extreme conditions.
